<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>IN THE MOUNTAINS</h3>
</div>
<p>A pallid sun, low, gleaming just over a rampart
of mountain-tops. Sundogs&ndash;&ndash;heralds of stormy
weather&ndash;&ndash;fiercely staring, like sentries, upon either
hand of the mighty sphere of light. Vast glaciers
shimmering jewel-like in the steely light of the semi-Arctic
evening. Black belts of gloomy pinewoods
on the lower slopes of the mountains; the trees
snow-burdened, but black with the darkness of night
in their melancholy depths. The earth white; snow
to the thickness of many feet on all. Life none; not
a beast of the earth, nor a fowl of the air, nor the
hum of an insect. Solitude. Cold&ndash;&ndash;grey, pitiless
cold. Night is approaching.</p>
<p>The hill ranges which backbone the American
continent&ndash;&ndash;the northern extremity of the Rocky
Mountains. The barrier which confronts the traveller
as he journeys from the Yukon Valley to the Alaskan
seaboard. Land where the foot of man but rarely
treads. And mid-winter.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span></div>
<p>But now, in the dying light of day, a man comes
slowly, painfully into the picture. What an atom
in that infinity of awful grandeur. One little life in
all that desert of snow and ice. And what a life.
The poor wretch was swathed in furs; snow-shoes
on his feet, and a long staff lent his drooping figure
support. His whole attitude told its own tale of
exhaustion. But a closer inspection, one glance into
the fierce-burning eyes, which glowered from the
depths of two cavernous sockets, would have added
a sequel of starvation. The eyes had a frenzied look
in them, the look of a man without hope, but with
still that instinct of life burning in his brain. Every
now and again he raised one mitted hand and
pressed it to nose and cheeks. He knew his face
was frozen, but he had no desire to stop to thaw
it out. He was beyond such trifles. His upturned
storm-collar had become massed with icicles about
his mouth, and the fur was frozen solidly to his chin
whisker, but he gave the matter no heed.</p>
<p>The man tottered on, still onward with the dogged
persistence which the inborn love of life inspires.
He longed to rest, to seat himself upon the snow
just where he happened to be, to indulge that craving
for sleep which was upon him. His state of exhaustion
fostered these feelings, and only his brain
fought for him and clung to life. He knew what
that drowsy sensation meant. He was slowly freezing.
To rest meant sleep&ndash;&ndash;to sleep meant death.</p>
<p>Slowly he dragged himself up the inclining ledge
he was traversing. The path was low at the base
of one of the loftiest crags. It wound its way upwards
in such a fashion that he could see little more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
than fifty yards ahead of him ere it turned away to
the left as it skirted the hill. He was using his last
reserve of strength, and he knew it. At the top he
stood half dazed. The mountain rose sheer up to
dizzy heights on one side, and a precipice was on the
other. He turned his dreadful eyes this way and
that. Then he scanned the prospect before him&ndash;&ndash;a
haze of dimly-outlined mountains. He glanced back,
tracing his uneven tracks until they disappeared in
the grey evening light. Then he turned back again
to a contemplation of what lay before him. Suddenly
his staff slipped from his hand as though he no
longer had the strength to grip it. Then, raising his
arms aloft, he gave vent to one despairing cry in which
was expressed all the pent-up agony of his soul. It
was the cry of one from whom all hope had gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;God! God have mercy on me! I am lost&ndash;&ndash;lost!&#8221;</p>
<p>The despairing note echoed and re-echoed among
the hills. And as each echo came back to his dulled
ears it was as though some invisible being mocked
him. Suddenly he braced himself, and his mind
obtained a momentary triumph over his physical
weakness. He stooped to recover his staff. His
limbs refused to obey his will. He stumbled. Then
he crumpled and fell in a heap upon the snow.</p>
<p>All was silent, and he lay quite still. Death
was gripping him, and he knew it. Presently he
wearily raised his head. He gazed about him with
eyelids more than half closed. &#8220;Is it worth the
struggle?&#8221; he seemed to ask; &#8220;is there any hope?&#8221;
He felt so warm, so comfortable out there in the
bitter winter air. Where had been the use of his
efforts? Where the use of the gold he had so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
laboriously collected at the new Eldorado? At the
thought of his gold his spirit tried to rouse him from
the sleep with which he was threatened. His eyelids
opened wide, and his eyes, from which intelligence
was fast disappearing, rolled in their gaunt
sockets. His body heaved as though he were about
to rise, but beyond that he did not move.</p>
<p>As he lay there a sound reached his numbed ears.
Clear through the crisp night air it came with the
keenness and piercing incision which is only obtained
in the still air of such latitudes. It was a human
cry: a long-drawn &#8220;whoop.&#8221; Like his own cry, it
echoed amongst the hills. It only needed such as
this to support the inclinations of the sufferer&#8217;s will.
His head was again raised. And in his wild eyes
was a look of alertness&ndash;&ndash;hope. He listened. He
counted the echoes as they came. Then, with an
almost superhuman effort, he struggled to his feet.
New life had come to him born of hope. His
weakened frame answered to his great effort. His
heart was throbbing wildly.</p>
<p>As he stood up the cry came to him again, nearer
this time. He moved forward and rounded the bend
in the path. Again the cry. Now just ahead of
him. He answered it with joy in his tone and
shambled on. Now two dark figures loomed up in
the grey twilight. They were moving swiftly along
the ledge towards him. They cried out something
in a foreign tongue. He did not understand, but
his joy was no less. They came up, and he saw
before him the short, stout figures of two fur-clad
Eskimos. He was saved.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></div>
<p>Inside a small dugout a dingy oil lamp shed its
murky rays upon squalid surroundings. The place
was reeking with the offensive odours exhaled from
the burning oil. The atmosphere was stifling.</p>
<p>There were four occupants of this abode, and,
stretched in various attitudes on dusty blankets
spread upon the ground, they presented a strange
picture. Two of these were Eskimos. The broad,
flat faces, sharp noses, and heavy lips were unmistakable,
as were their dusky, greasy skins and
squat figures. A third man was something between
the white-man and the redskin. He was in the nature
of a half-breed, and, though not exactly pleasant to
look upon, he was certainly interesting as a study.
He was lying with limbs outstretched and his head
propped upon one hand, while his gaze was directed
with thoughtful intensity towards a small, fierce-burning
camp-stove, which, at that moment, was
rendering the hut so unbearably hot.</p>
<p>His face was sallow, and indented with smallpox
scars. He had no hair upon it, except a tuft or two
of eyebrows, which the ravages of disease had condescended
to leave to him. His nose, which was his
best feature, was beaky, but beautifully aquiline;
but his mouth was wide, with a lower lip that sagged
loosely from its fellow above. His head was small,
and was burdened with a crown of lank black hair
which had been allowed to grow Indian-like until it
hung upon his shoulders. He was of medium height,
and his arms were of undue length.</p>
<p>The other occupant of the dugout was our traveller.
He was stretched upon a blanket, on which was
spread his fur coat; and he was alternating between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
the disposal of a bowl of steaming soup and groaning
with the racking pains caused by his recently
thawed-out frost-bites.</p>
<p>The soup warmed his starving body, and his pain
increased proportionately. In spite of the latter, however,
he felt very much alive. Occasionally he glanced
round upon his silent companions. Whenever he
did so one or the other, or both of the Eskimos were
gazing stolidly at him.</p>
<p>He was rather a good-looking man, notwithstanding
his now unkempt appearance. His eyes were
large&ndash;&ndash;very large in their hollow sockets. His nose
and cheeks were, at present, a mass of blisters from
the thawing frost-bites, and his mouth and chin were
hidden behind a curtain of whisker of about three
weeks&#8217; growth. There was no mistaking him for
anything but an Anglo-Saxon, and a man of considerable
and very fine proportions.</p>
<p>When his soup was finished he set the bowl down
and leaned back with a sigh. The pock-marked man
glanced over at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;More?&#8221; he said, in a deep, not unmusical, tone.</p>
<p>The half-starved traveller nodded, and his eyes
sparkled. One of the Eskimos rose and re-filled the
bowl from a tin camp-kettle which stood on the
stove. The famished man took it and at once began
to sup the invigorating liquid. The agonies of his
frost-bites were terrible, but the pangs of hunger
were greater. By and by the bowl was set down
empty.</p>
<p>The half-breed sat up and crossed his legs, and
leant his body against two sacks which contained
something that crackled slightly under his weight.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Give you something more solid in an hour or so.
Best not have it too soon,&#8221; he said, speaking slowly,
but with good enunciation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now?&#8221; said the traveller, in a disappointed
tone.</p>
<p>The other shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all going to have supper then. Best wait.&#8221;
Then, after a pause: &#8220;Where from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forty Mile Creek,&#8221; said the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say! Alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a curious saving of words in this man&#8217;s
mode of speech. Possibly he had learned this method
from his Indian associates.</p>
<p>The traveller nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The sea-coast.&#8221;</p>
<p>The half-breed laughed gutturally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forty Mile Creek. Sea-coast. On foot. Alone.
Winter. You must be mad.&#8221;</p>
<p>The traveller shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not mad. I could have done it, only I lost my
way. I had all my stages thought out carefully. I
tramped from the sea-coast originally. Where am I
now?&#8221;</p>
<p>The half-breed eyed the speaker curiously. He
seemed to think well before he answered. Then&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Within a few miles of the Pass. To the north.&#8221;</p>
<p>An impressive silence followed. The half-breed
continued to eye the sick man, and, to judge from
the expression of his face, his thoughts were not
altogether unpleasant. He watched the weary face
before him until the eyes gradually closed, and, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
spite of the burning pains of the frost-bites, exhaustion
did its work, and the man slept. He waited
for some moments listening to the heavy, regular
breathing, then he turned to his companions and
spoke long and earnestly in a curious tongue. One
of the Eskimos rose and removed a piece of bacon
from a nail in the wall. This he placed in the
camp-kettle on the stove. Then he took a tin billy
and dipped it full from a bucket containing beans
that had been set to soak. These also went into the
camp-kettle. Then the fellow threw himself down
again upon his blankets, and, for some time, the
three men continued to converse in low tones. They
glanced frequently at the sleeper, and occasionally
gurgled out a curious throaty chuckle. Their whole
attitude was furtive, and the man slept on.</p>
<p>An hour passed&ndash;&ndash;two. The third was more than
half gone. The hut reeked with the smell of cooking
victuals. The Eskimo, who seemed to act as cook,
occasionally looked into the camp-kettle. The other
two were lying on their blankets, sometimes conversing,
but more often silent, gazing stolidly before
them. At length the cook uttered a sharp ejaculation
and lifted the steaming kettle from its place on the
stove. Then he produced four deep pannikins from
a sack, and four greasy-looking spoons. From another
he produced a pile of biscuits. &#8220;Hard tack,&#8221; well
known on the northern trails.</p>
<p>Supper was ready, and the pock-marked man leant
over and roused the traveller.</p>
<p>&#8220;Food,&#8221; he said laconically, as the startled sleeper
rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>The man sat up and gazed hungrily at the iron pot.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
The Indian served out the pork with ruthless hands.
A knife divided the piece into four, and he placed
one in each pannikin. Then he poured the beans
and soup over each portion. The biscuits were placed
within reach, and the supper was served.</p>
<p>The sick man devoured his uncouth food with great
relish. The soup which had been first given him had
done him much good, and now the &#8220;solid&#8221; completed
the restoration so opportunely begun. He was a
vigorous man, and his exhaustion had chiefly been
brought about by lack of food. Now, as he sat with
his empty pannikin in front of him, he looked gratefully
over at his rescuers, and slowly munched some
dry biscuit, and sipped occasionally from a great
beaker of black coffee. Life was very sweet to him
at that moment, and he thought joyfully of the belt
inside his clothes laden with the golden result of his
labours on Forty Mile Creek.</p>
<p>Now the half-breed turned to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feeling pretty good?&#8221; he observed, conversationally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, thanks to you and your friends. You must
let me pay you for this.&#8221; The suggestion was coarsely
put. Returning strength was restoring the stranger
to his usual condition of mind. There was little
refinement about this man from the Yukon.</p>
<p>The other waived the suggestion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sour-belly&#8217;s pretty good tack when y&#8217; can&#8217;t get
any better. Been many days on the road?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three weeks.&#8221; The traveller was conscious of
three pairs of eyes fixed upon his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hoofing right along?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I missed the trail nearly a week back.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
Followed the track of a dog-train. It came some
distance this way. Then I lost it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Food ran out, maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The half-breed had now turned away, and was
gazing at the stove as though it had a great fascination
for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I meant to make the Pass where I could lay
in a fresh store. Instead of that I wandered on till I
found the empty pack got too heavy, then I left it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Left it?&#8221; The half-breed raised his two little
tufts of eyebrows, but his eyes remained staring at
the stove.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it was empty&ndash;&ndash;clean empty. You see, I
didn&#8217;t trust anything but food in my pack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. That&#8217;s so. Maybe gold isn&#8217;t safe in a
pack?&#8221;</p>
<p>The pock-marked face remained turned towards
the glowing stove. The man&#8217;s manner was quite
indifferent. It suggested that he merely wished to
talk.</p>
<p>The traveller seemed to draw back into his shell
at the mention of gold. A slight pause followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you ain&#8217;t been digging up there?&#8221; the
half-breed went on presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rotten bad digging on the Creek,&#8221; the traveller
said, clumsily endeavouring to evade the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;ve heard,&#8221; said the half-breed.</p>
<p>He had produced a pipe, and was leisurely filling
it from a pouch of antelope hide. His two companions
did the same. The stranger took his pipe
from his fur coat pocket and cut some tobacco from
a plug. This he offered to his companions, but it was
rejected in favour of their own.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The only thing I&#8217;ve had&ndash;&ndash;that and my fur coat&ndash;&ndash;to
keep me from freezing to death for more than four
days. Haven&#8217;t so much as seen a sign of life since I
lost the dog track.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This country&#8217;s a terror,&#8221; observed the half-breed
emphatically.</p>
<p>All four men lit their pipes. The sick man only
drew once or twice at his, then he laid it aside. The
process of smoking caused the blisters on his face to
smart terribly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gives your face gyp,&#8221; said the half-breed, sympathetically.
&#8220;Best not bother to smoke to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pulled vigorously at his own pipe, and the
two Indians followed suit. And gradually a pleasant
odour, not of tobacco but some strange perfume,
disguised the reek of the atmosphere. It was
pungent but delightful, and the stranger remarked
upon it.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that you are smoking?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>For one instant the half-breed&#8217;s eyes were turned
upon him with a curious look. Then he turned back
to the contemplation of the stove.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kind o&#8217; weed that grows around these wilds,&#8221; he
answered. &#8220;Only stuff we get hereabouts. It&#8217;s good
when you&#8217;re used to it.&#8221; He laughed quietly.</p>
<p>The stranger looked from one to the other of his
three companions. He was struck by a sudden
thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you do here? I mean for a living?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trap,&#8221; replied the Breed shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many furs about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Slow work,&#8221; said the stranger, indifferently.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></div>
<p>Then a silence fell. The wayfarer was getting
very drowsy. The pungent odour from his companions&#8217;
pipes seemed to have a strangely soothing
effect upon him. Before he was aware of it he caught
himself nodding, and, try as he would, he could not
keep his heavy eyelids open. The men smoked on
in silence. Three pairs of eyes watched the stranger&#8217;s
efforts to keep awake, and a malicious gleam was in
the look with which they surveyed him. He was too
sleepy to observe. Besides, had he been in condition
to do so, the expression of their eyes would probably
have been different. Slowly his head drooped forward.
He was dreaming pleasantly already, although,
as yet, he was not quite asleep. Now he no longer
attempted to keep his eyes open. Further his head
drooped forward. The three men were still as mice.
Then suddenly he rolled over on one side, and his
stertorous breathing indicated a deep, unnatural
slumber.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The hut was in darkness but for a beam of light
which made its way in through a narrow slit over the
door. The sunlight shone down upon the huddled
figure of the traveller, who still slept in the attitude
in which he had rolled over on his fur coat when
sleep had first overcome him. Otherwise the hut
was empty. The half-breed and his companions had
disappeared. The fire was out. The lamp had
burned itself out. The place was intensely cold.</p>
<p>Suddenly the sleeper stirred. He straightened
himself out and turned over. Then, without further
warning, he sat up and found himself staring up at
the dazzling streak of light.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Daylight,&#8221; he murmured; &#8220;and they&#8217;ve let the
stove go out. Gee! but I feel queer about the head.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moving his head so that his eyes should miss the
glare of light, he gazed about him. He was alone,
and as he realized this he scrambled to his feet, and,
for the moment, the room&ndash;&ndash;everything about him&ndash;&ndash;seemed
to be turning topsy-turvy. He placed his
hand against the post which supported the roof and
steadied himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder where they are?&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Ah!
of course,&#8221; as an afterthought, &#8220;they are out at their
traps. They might have stoked the fire. It&#8217;s perishing
in here. I feel beastly queer; must be the effects
of starvation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he moved a step forward. He brought up
suddenly to a standstill. His two hands went to his
waist. They moved, groping round it spasmodically.
Undoing his clothes he passed his hand into his shirt.
Then one word escaped him. One word&ndash;&ndash;almost a
whisper&ndash;&ndash;but conveying such a world of fierce, horror-stricken
intensity&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Robbed!&#8221;</p>
<p>And the look which accompanied his exclamation
was the look of a man whose mind is distracted.</p>
<p>So he stood for some seconds. His lips moved,
but no words escaped them. His hand remained
within his shirt, and his fingers continued to grope
about mechanically. And all the time the dazed,
strained look burned in his great, roving eyes.</p>
<p>It was gone. That broad belt, weighted down with
the result of one year&#8217;s toil, gold dust and nuggets,
was gone. Presently he seated himself on the cold
iron of the stove. Thus he sat for an hour, looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
straight before him with eyes that seemed to draw
closer together, so intense was their gaze. And who
shall say what thoughts he thought; what wild
schemes of revenge he planned? There was no outward
sign. Just those silent moving lips.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>MR. ZACHARY SMITH</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Rot, man, rot! I&#8217;ve been up here long enough
to know my way about this devil&#8217;s country. No
confounded neche can teach me. The trail forked at
that bush we passed three days back. We&#8217;re all
right. I wish I felt as sure about the weather.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leslie Grey broke off abruptly. His tone was
resentful, as well as dictatorial. He was never what
one might call an easy man. He was always headstrong,
and never failed to resent interference on the
smallest provocation. Perhaps these things were in
the nature of his calling. He was one of the head
Customs officials on the Canadian side of the Alaskan
boundary. His companion was a subordinate.</p>
<p>The latter was a man of medium height, and from
the little that could be seen of his face between the
high folds of the storm-collar of his buffalo coat, he
possessed a long nose and a pair of dark, keen, yet
merry eyes. His name was Robb Chillingwood. The
two men were tramping along on snow-shoes in the
rear of a dog-train. An Indian was keeping pace
with the dogs in front; the latter, five in number,
harnessed in the usual tandem fashion to a heavily-laden
sled.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use anticipating bad weather,&#8221; replied
Chillingwood, quietly. &#8220;But as to the question of
the trail&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no question,&#8221; interrupted Grey, sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, the map shows two clumps of bush. The trail
turns off at one of them. My chart says the second.
I studied it carefully. The &#8216;confounded neche,&#8217; as
you call him, says &#8216;not yet.&#8217; Which means that he
considers it to be the second bush. You say no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The neche only knows the trail by repute. You
have never been over it before. I have travelled it
six times. You make me tired. Give it a rest.
Perhaps you can make something of those nasty,
sharp puffs of wind which keep lifting the ground
snow at intervals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robb shrugged his fur-coated shoulders, and glanced
up at the sun. It seemed to be struggling hard to
pierce a grey haze which hung over the mountains.
The sundogs, too, could be seen, but, like the sun
itself, they were dim and glowed rather than shone.
That patchy wind, so well known in the west of
Canada, was very evident just then. It seemed to
hit the snow-bound earth, slither viciously along the
surface, sweep up a thin cloud of loose surface snow,
then drop in an instant, but only to operate in the
same manner at some other spot. This was going on
spasmodically in many directions, the snow brushing
up in hissing eddies at each attack. And slowly the
grey mist on the hills was obscuring the sun.</p>
<p>Robb Chillingwood was a man of some experience
on the prairie, although, as his companion had said, he
was new to this particular mountain trail. To his
trained eye the outlook was not encouraging.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Storm,&#8221; he observed shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my opinion,&#8221; said Grey definitely.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to calculations, if we have not got off
the trail,&#8221; Chillingwood went on, with a sly look at
his superior, &#8220;we should reach Dougal&#8217;s roadside
hostelry in the Pass by eight o&#8217;clock&ndash;&ndash;well before
dark. We ought to escape the storm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean we shall,&#8221; said Grey pointedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bunkum!&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men relapsed into silence. They were
very good friends these two. Both were used to
the strenuous northern winter. Both understood the
dangers of a blizzard. Their argument about the
trail they were on was quite a friendly one. It was
only the dictatorial manner of Leslie Grey which
gave it the appearance of a quarrel. Chillingwood
understood him, and took no notice of his somewhat
irascible remarks, whilst, for himself, he remained of
opinion that he had read his Ordnance chart aright.</p>
<p>They tramped on. Each man, with a common
thought, was watching the weather indications. As
the time passed the wind &#8220;patches&#8221; grew in size, in
force, and in frequency of recurrence. The haze upon
the surrounding hills rapidly deepened, and the air
was full of frost particles. A storm was coming on
apace. Nor was Dougal&#8217;s wayside hostelry within
sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a rotten life on the boundary,&#8221; said Robb, as
though continuing a thought aloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not so much the life,&#8221; replied Grey vindictively,
&#8220;it&#8217;s the d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;d red tape that demands the half-yearly
journey down country. That&#8217;s the dog&#8217;s part
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
of our business. Why can&#8217;t they establish a branch
bank up here for the bullion and send all &#8216;returns&#8217; by
mail? There is a postal service&ndash;&ndash;of a kind. It&#8217;s a
one-horsed lay out&ndash;&ndash;Government work. There&#8217;ll come
a rush to the Yukon valley this year, and when there&#8217;s
a chance of doing something for ourselves&ndash;&ndash;having
done all we can for the Government&ndash;&ndash;I suppose they&#8217;ll
shift us. It&#8217;s the way of Governments. I&#8217;m sick of it.
I draw four thousand dollars a year, and I earn every
cent of it. You&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Draw one thousand, and think myself lucky if I
taste fresh vegetables once a week during the summer.
Say, Leslie, do you think it&#8217;s possible to assimilate
the humble but useful hog by means of a steady diet
of &#8216;sour-belly&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Grey laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that were possible I guess we ought to make
the primest bacon. Hallo, here comes the d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;d
neche. What&#8217;s up now, I wonder? Well, Rainy-Moon,
what is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian had stopped his dogs and now turned
back to speak to the two men. His face was expressionless.
He was a tall specimen of the Cree Indian.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh,&#8221; he grunted, as he came to a standstill.
Then he stretched out his arm with a wide sweep in
the direction of the mountains. &#8220;No good, white-men&ndash;&ndash;coyote,
yes. So,&#8221; and he pointed to the south
and made a motion of running, &#8220;yes. Plenty beef,
plenty fire-water. White-man store.&#8221; His face slowly
expanded into a smile. Then the smile died out
suddenly and he turned to the north and made a long
&#8216;soo-o-o-sh&#8217; with rising intonation, signifying the rising
wind. &#8220;Him very bad. White-man sleep&ndash;&ndash;sleep.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
Wake&ndash;&ndash;no.&#8221; And he finished up with a shake of the
head.</p>
<p>Then his arm dropped to his side, and he waited
for Grey to speak. For a moment the Customs
officer remained silent. Chillingwood waited anxiously.
Both men understood the Indian&#8217;s meaning.
Chillingwood believed the man to be right about
the trail. As to the coming storm, and the probable
consequences if they were caught in it, that
was patent to all three.</p>
<p>But Grey, with characteristic pig-headedness, gave
no heed to the superior intelligence of the Indian
where matters of direction in a wild country were
concerned. He <i>knew</i> he was on the right trail. That
was sufficient for him. But he surveyed the surrounding
mountains well before he spoke. They had
halted in a sort of cup-like hollow, with towering sides
surmounted by huge glaciers down which the wind
was now whistling with vicious force. There were
only two exits from this vast arena. The one by
which the travellers had entered it, and the other
directly ahead of them; the latter was only to be
approached by a wide ledge which skirted one of the
mountains and inclined sharply upwards. Higher up
the mountain slope was a belt of pinewoods, close to
which was a stubbly growth of low bush. This was
curiously black in contrast with the white surroundings,
for no snow was upon its weedy branches and
shrivelled, discoloured leaves. Suddenly, while Grey
was looking out beyond the dog-train, he observed the
impress of snow-shoes in the snow. He pointed to
them and drew his companion&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he said triumphantly, &#8220;there has been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
some one passing this way just ahead of us. Look
here, neche, you just get right on and don&#8217;t let me
have any more nonsense about the trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ow,&#8221; he grunted. &#8220;This little&ndash;&ndash;just little.&#8221;
Then he pointed ahead. &#8220;Big, white&ndash;&ndash;all white.
No, no; white-man no come dis way. Bimeby neche
so,&#8221; and Rainy-Moon made a motion of lying down
and sleeping. He meant that they would get lost and
die in the snow.</p>
<p>Grey became angry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get on,&#8221; he shouted. And Rainy-Moon reluctantly
turned and started his dogs afresh.</p>
<p>The little party ascended the sloping path. The
whipping snow lashed their faces as the wind rushed
it up from the ground in rapidly thickening clouds. The
fierce gusts were concentrating into a steady shrieking
blast. A grey cloud of snow, thin as yet, but
plainly perceptible, was in the air. The threat it conveyed
was no idle one. The terror of the blizzard
was well known to those people. And they knew
that in a short space they would have to seek what
shelter they might chance to find upon these almost
barren mountains.</p>
<p>The white-men tightened the woollen scarves about
the storm-collars of their coats, and occasionally
beat their mitted hands against their sides. The
gathering wind was intensifying the cold.</p>
<p>&#8220;If this goes on we shall have to make that belt of
pinewoods for shelter,&#8221; observed Robb Chillingwood
practically. &#8220;It won&#8217;t do to take chances of losing
the dogs&ndash;&ndash;and their load&ndash;&ndash;in the storm. What say?&#8221;</p>
<p>They had rounded a bend and Grey was watchfully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
gazing ahead. He did not seem to hear his companion&#8217;s
question. Suddenly he pointed directly
along the path towards a point where it seemed to
vanish between two vast crags.</p>
<p>&#8220;Smoke,&#8221; he said. And his tone conveyed that he
wished his companion to understand that he, Grey,
had been right about the trail, and that Robb had
been wrong. &#8220;That&#8217;s Dougal&#8217;s store,&#8221; he went on,
after a slight pause.</p>
<p>Chillingwood looked as directed. He saw the rush
of smoke which, in the rising storm, was ruthlessly
swept from the mouth of a piece of upright stove-pipe,
which in the now grey surroundings could just be
distinguished.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I thought there was a broad, open trail at
Dougal&#8217;s,&#8221; he said, at last, after gazing for some
moments at the tiny smoke-stack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe the road opens out here,&#8221; answered Grey
weakly.</p>
<p>But it didn&#8217;t. Instead it narrowed. And as they
ascended the slope it became more and more precipitous.
The storm was now beating up, seemingly from
every direction, and it was with difficulty that the five
great huskies hauled their burden in the face of it.
However, Rainy-Moon urged them to their task with
no light hand, and just as the storm settled down to
its work in right good earnest they drew up abreast
of a small dugout. The path had narrowed down to
barely six feet in width, bordered on the left hand by
a sharp slope upwards towards the pinewood belt
above, and on the right by a sheer precipice; whilst
fifty feet further on there was no more path&ndash;&ndash;just
space. As this became apparent to him, Robb Chillingwood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
could not help wondering what their fate
might have been had the storm overtaken them earlier,
and they had not come upon the dugout. However,
he had no time for much speculation on the subject,
for, as the dogs came to a stand, the door of the dugout
was thrown back and a tall, cadaverous-looking
man stood framed in the opening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kind o&#8217; struck it lucky,&#8221; he observed, without any
great show of enthusiasm. &#8220;Come right in. The
neche can take the dogs round the side there,&#8221;
pointing to the left of the dugout. &#8220;There&#8217;s a
weatherproof shack there where I keep my kindling.
Guess he can fix up in that till this d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;d breeze
has blown itself out. You&#8217;ve missed the trail, I take
it. Come right in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Half-an-hour later the two Customs officers were
seated with their host round the camp-stove which
stood hissing and spluttering in the centre of the
hut. The dogs and Rainy-Moon were housed in the
woodshed.</p>
<p>Now that the travellers were divested of their
heavy furs, their appearance was less picturesque but
more presentable. Robb Chillingwood was about
twenty-five; his whole countenance indexed a sturdy
honesty of thought and a merry disposition. There
was considerable strength too about brow and jaw.
Leslie Grey was shorter than his companion. A man
of dapper, sturdy figure, and with a face good-looking,
obstinate, and displaying as much sense of
humour as a barbed-wire fence post. He was fully
thirty years of age.</p>
<p>Their host possessed a long, attenuated, but powerful
figure, and a face chiefly remarkable for its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
cadaverous hollows and a pair of hungry eyes and a
dark chin-whisker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; this individual was saying, &#8220;she&#8217;s goin&#8217;
to howl good and hard for the next forty-eight hours,
or I don&#8217;t know these parts. Maybe you&#8217;re from the
valley?&#8221;</p>
<p>Chillingwood shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Fort Cudahy way,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My name&#8217;s
Chillingwood&ndash;&ndash;Robb Chillingwood. This is Mr.
Leslie Grey, Customs officer. I am his assistant.&#8221;</p>
<p>The long man glanced slowly at his guests. His
great eyes seemed to take in the details of each man&#8217;s
appearance with solemn curiosity. Then he twisted
slowly upon the upturned box on which he was
seated and crossed his legs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pleased to meet you, gentlemen. It&#8217;s lonely
in these parts&ndash;&ndash;lonely.&#8221; He shuddered as though
with cold. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been trapping in these latitudes for
a considerable period, and it&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;lonely. My name is
Zachary Smith.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the trapper pronounced his name he glanced
keenly from one to the other of the two men beside
him. His look was suggestive of doubt. He seemed
to be trying to re-assure himself that he had never
before crossed the paths of these chance guests of
his. After a moment of apprehensive silence he
went on slowly, like one groping in darkness. His
confidence was not fully established.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can make up your minds to a couple of days
in this shanty&ndash;&ndash;anyhow. I mostly live on &#8216;sour-belly&#8217;
and &#8216;hard tack.&#8217; Don&#8217;t sound inviting,
eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Chillingwood laughed pleasantly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re Government officials,&#8221; he said with meaning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; put in Grey. &#8220;But we&#8217;ve got plenty of
canned truck in our baggage. I&#8217;m thinking you may
find our supplies a pleasant change.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt&ndash;&ndash;no doubt whatever. Cat&#8217;s meat would
be a delicacy after&ndash;&ndash;months of tallowy pork.&#8221;</p>
<p>This slow-spoken trapper surveyed his guests
thoughtfully. The travellers were enjoying the comforting
shelter and warmth. Neither of them seemed
particularly talkative.</p>
<p>Presently Grey roused himself. Extreme heat
after extreme cold always has a somnolent effect on
those who experience it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d best get the&ndash;&ndash;stuff off the sleigh, Chillingwood,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Rainy-Moon&#8217;s above the average
Indian for honesty, but, nevertheless, we don&#8217;t need
to take chances. And,&#8221; as the younger man rose
and stretched himself, &#8220;food is good on occasions.
What does Mr. Zachary Smith say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, let&#8217;s sample some white-man&#8217;s grub. Gentlemen,
this is a fortunate meeting&ndash;&ndash;all round.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chillingwood passed out of the hut. As he opened
the door a vindictive blast of wind swept a cloud of
snow in, and the frozen particles fell crackling and
hissing upon the glowing stove.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they call this a white-man&#8217;s country,&#8221; observed
Mr. Smith pensively, as the door closed again. He
opened the stove and proceeded to knock the embers
together preparatory to stoking up afresh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you were making for the Pass,&#8221; he said
conversationally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Grey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Missed the trail,&#8221; the other said, pitching a cord-wood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
stick accurately into the centre of the glowing
embers.</p>
<p>Grey made no answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tisn&#8217;t in the way of Governments to show consideration
to their servants,&#8221; Mr. Smith went on,
filling the stove with fuel to the limit of its holding
capacity. &#8220;It&#8217;s a deadly season to be forced to
travel about in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Consideration,&#8221; said Grey bitterly. &#8220;I&#8217;m forced
to undertake this journey twice a year. Which
means I am on the road the best part of my time.
And merely because there is no bank or authorized
place for depositing&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, gold,&#8221; put in Mr. Zachary Smith quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And reams of &#8216;returns.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They reckon that the &#8216;rush&#8217; to the Yukon&#8217;ll come
next year. Maybe things will alter then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith straightened himself up from his occupation.
His face displayed but the most ordinary interest in
the conversation.</p>
<p>At that moment Chillingwood returned bearing
two small brass-bound chests. The Indian followed
him bringing a number of packages of tinned food.
Smith glanced from the chests&ndash;&ndash;which were as much
as Chillingwood could carry&ndash;&ndash;to the angular proportions
of the Indian&#8217;s burden, then back again to
the chests. He watched furtively as the officer
deposited the latter; then he turned back to the
stove and opened the damper.</p>
<p>Then followed a meal of which all three partook
with that heartiness which comes of an appetite
induced by a hardy open-air life. They talked but
little while they ate, and that little was of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
prospects of the new Eldorado. Leslie Grey spoke
with the bitterness of a disappointed man. In reality
he had been successful in the business he had adopted.
But some men are born grumblers, and he was one.
It is probable that had he been born a prince he
would have loudly lamented the fact that he was not
a king. Chillingwood was different; he accepted the
situation and enjoyed his life. He was unambitious
whilst faithfully doing that which he regarded as his
duty, first to himself, then to his employers. His
method of life was something like that of the sailor.
He fully appreciated the motto of the seafaring
gentry&ndash;&ndash;one hand for himself and one for his
employers. When in doubt both hands for self.
He meant to break away from his present employment
when the Yukon &#8220;rush&#8221; came. In the meantime
he was on the spot. Mr. Zachary Smith chiefly
listened. He could eat and watch his guests. He
could study them. And he seemed in no way
inclined to waste his time on words when he could
do the other two things. He said little about himself,
and was mainly contented with comprehensive nods
and grunts, whilst he devoured huge portions of
tinned tongue and swallowed bumpers of scalding
tea.</p>
<p>After dinner the travellers produced their pipes.
Grey offered his tobacco to their host. Mr. Zachary
Smith shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given up tobacco&ndash;&ndash;mostly,&#8221; he said, glancing in
the direction of the door, which groaned under a
sudden attack from the storm which was now howling
with terrible force outside. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t that I don&#8217;t
like it. But when a man gets cooped up in these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
hills he&#8217;s like to run out of it, and then it&#8217;s uncomfortable.
I&#8217;ve taken on a native weed which does me
for smoking when I need it&ndash;&ndash;which isn&#8217;t often. It
grows hereabouts and isn&#8217;t likely to give out. Guess
I won&#8217;t smoke now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grey shrugged and lit his pipe. If any man could
be fool enough to reject tobacco, Leslie Grey was
not the sort of man to press him. He was intolerant
of ideas in any one but himself. Chillingwood
sucked luxuriously at his pipe and thought big
things.</p>
<p>The blue smoke clouds curled insinuatingly about
the heads of the smokers, and rose heavily upon the
dense atmosphere of the hut. The two men stretched
themselves indolently upon the ground, sometimes
speaking, but, for the most part, silent. These wayfarers
thought little of time. They had a certain
task to perform which, the elements permitting, they
would carry out in due course. In the meantime it
was storming, and they had been fortunate in finding
shelter in these wastes of snow and ice; they were
glad to accept what comfort came their way. This
enforced delay would find a simple record in Leslie
Grey&#8217;s report to his superiors. &#8220;Owing to a heavy
storm, etc.&#8221; They were Government servants. The
routine of these men&#8217;s lives was all very monotonous,
but they were used to it, and use is a wonderful
thing. It so closely borders on content.</p>
<p>Cards were produced later on. Mr. Zachary Smith
resisted the blandishments of &#8220;cut-throat&#8221; euchre.
He had no money to spare for gambling, he informed
his guests; he would look on. He sat over the stove
whilst the others played. Later on the cards were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
put away, and the travellers, curling themselves into
their blankets, composed themselves to sleep.</p>
<p>The lean figure sat silently blinking at the red sides
of the fire-box. His legs were crossed, and he nursed
his knee in a restful embrace. For nearly an hour he
sat thus, and only the slow movement of his great
rolling eyes, and an occasional inclination of his head
told of the active thought which was passing behind
his mask-like features.</p>
<p>As he sat there he looked older by half a score of
years than either of his companions, but, in reality,
he was a young man. The furrows and hollows upon
his face were the marks of privation and exposure,
not of age. His bowed figure was not the result of
weakness or senility, it was chiefly the result of
great height and the slouching gait of one who has
done much slow tramping. Mr. Zachary Smith made
an interesting study as he sat silently beside his
stove.</p>
<p>His face was the face of an honest man&ndash;&ndash;when his
eyes were concealed beneath their heavy lids. It was
a good face, and refined; tough, vigorous, honest,
until the eyelids were raised. Then the expression
was utterly changed. A something looked out from
those great rolling eyeballs which was furtive, watchful,
doubtful. They were eyes one sometimes sees in
a madman or a great criminal. And now, as he sat
absorbed in his own reflections, their gaze alternated
between the two brass-bound chests and the recumbent
figure of Leslie Grey.</p>
<p>So he sat, this self-styled Zachary Smith, trapper.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>MR. ZACHARY SMITH SMOKES</h3>
</div>
<p>It was the third morning of the travellers&#8217; sojourn
in Mr. Smith&#8217;s dugout. Two long idle days had been
spent in the f&oelig;tid atmosphere of the trapper&#8217;s half-buried
house. During their enforced stay neither
Grey nor his subordinates had learnt much of their
reticent host. It is doubtful if they had troubled
themselves much about him. He had greeted them
with a sort of indifferent hospitality, and they were
satisfied. It was not in the nature of their work to
question the characters of those whom they encountered
upon their journey. To all that he had Mr. Zachary
Smith had made them welcome; they could expect
no more, they needed no more. Now the day had
arrived for their departure, for the storm had subsided
and the sun was shining with all its wintry splendour.</p>
<p>The three men leisurely devoured an early morning
breakfast.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith was quite cheerful. He seemed to be
labouring under some strange excitement. He looked
better, too, since the advent of his guests. Perhaps
it was the result of the ample supplies of canned
provisions which the two men had lavished unsparingly
upon him. His face was less cadaverous; the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
deep searing furrows were less pronounced. Altogether
there was a marked improvement in this
solitary dweller in the wild. Now he was discussing
the prospects of the weather, whilst he partook liberally
of the food set before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;These things aren&#8217;t like most storms,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;They blow themselves out and have done with it.
They don&#8217;t come back on you with a change of wind.
That isn&#8217;t the way of the blizzard. We&#8217;ve got a clear
spell of a fortnight and more before us&ndash;&ndash;with luck.
Now, which way may you be taking, gentlemen? Are
you going to head through the mountains for the
main trail, or are you going to double on your
tracks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going back,&#8221; said Grey, with unpleasant
emphasis. Any allusion to his mistake of the road
annoyed him.</p>
<p>Chillingwood turned his head away and hid a
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you will do well,&#8221; replied the trapper
largely. &#8220;I know these hills, and I should be inclined
to hark back to where you missed the trail. I hope
to cover twenty miles myself to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your traps will be buried, I should say,&#8221; suggested
Robb.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m used to that,&#8221; replied the tall man quietly.
&#8220;Guess I shan&#8217;t have much difficulty with &#8217;em.&#8221; He
permitted himself the suspicion of a smile.</p>
<p>Grey drew out his pipe and leisurely loaded it.
Robb followed suit. Mr. Zachary Smith pushed his
tin pannikin away from before him and leaned back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to smoke?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll join
you. No, not your plug, thanks. I&#8217;m feeling pretty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
good. My weed&#8217;ll do me. You don&#8217;t fancy to try
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;T. and B.&#8217;s good enough for me,&#8221; said Grey, with
a smile. &#8220;No, I won&#8217;t experiment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith held his pouch towards Chillingwood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I?&#8221;</p>
<p>Robb shook his head with a doubtful smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess not, thanks. What&#8217;s good enough for my
chief is good enough for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The trapper slowly unfolded an antelope hide
pouch of native workmanship. He emptied out a
little pile of greenish-brown flakes into the palm of
his hand. It was curious, dusty-looking stuff, suggestive
of discoloured bran. This he poured into the
bowl of a well-worn briar, the mouthpiece of which
he carefully and with accuracy adjusted into the corner
of his mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you ever chance to have the experience I have
had in these mountains, gentlemen,&#8221; he then went on
slowly, as gathering into the palm of his hand a red-hot
cinder from the stove he tossed it to and fro until
it lodged on the bowl of his pipe, &#8220;I think you&#8217;ll find
the use of the weed which grows on this hillside,&#8221; with
a jerk of his head upwards to indicate the bush which
flourished in that direction, &#8220;has its advantages.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; said Grey contemptuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I doubt it,&#8221; said Robb, with a pleasant smile.</p>
<p>The lean man knocked the cinder from his pipe
and emitted a cloud of pungent smoke from between
his lips. The others had lit up. But the odour of the
trapper&#8217;s weed quickly dominated the atmosphere.
He talked rapidly now.</p>
<p>&#8220;You folks who travel the main trails don&#8217;t see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
much of what is going on in the mountains&ndash;&ndash;the real
life of the mountains,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You have no conception
of the real dangers which these hills contain.
Yes, sir, they&#8217;re hidden from the public eye, and only
get to be known outside by reason of the chance
experience of the traveller who happens to lose his
way, but is lucky enough to escape the pitfalls with
which he finds himself surrounded. I could tell you
some queer yarns of these hills.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Travellers&#8217; tales,&#8221; suggested Grey, with a yawn and
a disparaging smile. &#8220;I have heard some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Robb, &#8220;there are queer tales afloat of
adventures encountered by travellers journeying from
the valley to the coast. But they&#8217;re chiefly confined
to wayside robbery, and are of a very sordid, everyday
kind. No doubt your experiences are less matter-of-fact
and more romantic. By Jove, I feel jolly
comfy. Not much like turning out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how it takes me,&#8221; said Smith quietly, but
with a quick glance at the speaker. &#8220;But idleness
won&#8217;t boil my pot. It&#8217;s a remarkable thing that I&#8217;ve
felt wonderfully energetic these last few days, and
now that I have to turn out I should prefer to stop
where I am. I s&#8217;pose it&#8217;s human nature.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gazed upon his audience with a broad smile.</p>
<p>At that moment the loud yelping of the dogs penetrated
the thick sides of the dugout. Rainy-Moon
was preparing for the start. Doubtless the brilliant
change in the weather had inspired the savage burden-bearers
of the north.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s curious-smelling stuff you&#8217;re smoking,&#8221; said
Grey, rousing himself with an effort after a moment&#8217;s
dead silence. &#8220;What do you call it?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say&ndash;&ndash;a weed,&#8221; said Zachary Smith, glancing
down his nose towards the bowl of his pipe. &#8220;Not
bad, is it? Smells of almonds&ndash;&ndash;tastes like nutty
sherry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grey stifled a yawn.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel sleepy, d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;d sleepy. Wonder if Rainy-Moon
has got the sleigh loaded.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith emitted another dense cloud of smoke from
between his pursed lips; he seemed wrapt in the
luxurious enjoyment of his smoke. Robb Chillingwood&#8217;s
eyelids were drooping, and his pipe had gone
out. Quite suddenly the trapper&#8217;s eyes were turned
on the face of Grey, and the smoke from his pipe was
chiefly directed towards him.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s time enough yet,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;Half-an-hour
more or less won&#8217;t make much difference to
you on the road. You were talking of travellers&#8217; tales,
and I reckon you were thinking of fairy yarns that
some folks think it smart to spin. Well, maybe those
same stories have some foundation in fact, and ain&#8217;t
all works of imagination. Anyhow, my experience
has taught me never to disbelieve until I&#8217;ve some good
sound grounds for doing so.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused and gazed with a far-off look at the
opposite wall. Then a shadowy smile stole over his
face, and he went on. His companions&#8217; heads had
drooped slowly forward, and their eyes were heavy
with sleep. Grey was fighting against the drowsiness
by jerking his head sharply upwards, but his eyes
would close in spite of his efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I never thought that I&#8217;d get caught napping,&#8221;
continued Smith, with a chuckle. &#8220;I thought
I knew these regions well enough, but I didn&#8217;t. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
lost my way, too, and came near to losing my
life&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off abruptly as Robb Chillingwood
slowly rolled over on his side and began to snore
loudly. Then Smith turned back to Leslie Grey, and
leaning forward, so that his face was close to that of
the officer, blew clouds of the pungent smoke right
across the half-stupefied man&#8217;s mouth and nostrils.</p>
<p>&#8220;I lost other things,&#8221; he then went on meditatively,
&#8220;but not my life. I lost that which was more
precious to me. I lost gold&ndash;&ndash;gold! I lost the result
of many weary months of toil. I had hoarded it up
that I might go down to the east and buy a nice little
ranch, and settle down into a comfortable, respectable
man of property. I didn&#8217;t even wait until the spring
opened so that I could take the river route. No,
that wasn&#8217;t my way, because I knew it would cost a
lot of money and I wasn&#8217;t overburdened with wealth.
I had just enough&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He puffed vigorously at his pipe. Grey&#8217;s head was
now hanging forward and his chin rested on his chest.</p>
<p>There came the sound of Rainy-Moon&#8217;s voice
adjuring the dogs outside the door of the dugout.
The trapper&#8217;s eyes flashed evilly in the direction of
the unconscious Indian.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;to do what I wanted,&#8221; he resumed. &#8220;No
more&ndash;&ndash;no less; and I set out on foot.&#8221; He was
anxiously watching for Grey&#8217;s collapse. &#8220;Yes, I was
going to tramp to the sea-coast through these mountains.
I hit the wrong trail, decoyed by a false track
carefully made by those who waited for me in these
hills.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;Grey was swaying heavily and his breathing
was stertorous.&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I met my fate and was robbed of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
my gold. I was drugged&ndash;&ndash;as you poor fools are
being drugged now. When it was too late I discovered
how it was done, and determined to do the
same thing by the first victim that fell into my
clutches. I tried the weed and soon got used to its
fumes. Then I waited&ndash;&ndash;waited. I had set my decoy
at the cross-roads, and you&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;came.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the trapper ceased speaking Grey slowly rolled
over, insensible.</p>
<p>In a moment the watching man was upon his feet.
His whole face was transfigured. Alertness was in
every movement, in every flash of his great eyes.
He moved quickly across the floor of the hut and
took two shallow pannikins from the sack which lay
upon the floor, dropped some of the flaky weed into
the bottom of each one, and then from the stove he
scraped some coals of fire into them. The fire set
the dry weed smouldering, and the thick smoke rose
heavily from the two tins. These he placed upon the
ground in such a position that his hard-breathing
victims should thoroughly inhale the fumes. Thus
he would make doubly sure of them.</p>
<p>This done he stood erect and gazed for some
seconds at the result of his handiwork; he was
satisfied, but there was no look of pleasure on his
face. He did not look like a man of naturally criminal
instincts. There was nothing savage about his expression,
or even callous. His look merely seemed
to say that he had set himself this task, and, so far,
what he had done was satisfactory in view of his
object. He turned from the heavy-slumbering men
and his eyes fell upon the two small gold chests.
Instantly his whole expression changed. Here was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
the keynote to the man&#8217;s disposition. Gold! It was
the gold he coveted. At all costs that gold was to
be his. His eyes shone with greed. He moved
towards the boxes as though he were about to handle
them; but he paused abruptly before he reached
them. The barking of the dogs and the strident
tones of the Indian&#8217;s voice outside arrested him. He
suddenly remembered that he had not yet completed
his work.</p>
<p>Now he moved with unnecessarily stealthy steps
over to the darkest corner of the hut, to where a pile
of rough skins stood. The steady nerve which had
hitherto served him seemed in a measure to have
weakened. It was a phase which a man of his disposition
must inevitably pass through in the perpetration
of a first crime. He was assailed by a sensation
of watching eyes following his every movement;
with a feeling that another presence than those two
slumbering forms moved with him in the dim light of
the dugout. He was haunted by his other self; the
moral self.</p>
<p>From beneath the pile of furs he drew a heavy
revolver which he carefully examined. The chambers
were loaded.</p>
<p>Again came the sound of the dogs outside. And
he even fancied he heard the shuffling of Rainy-Moon&#8217;s
moccasins over the beaten snow just outside
the door. He turned his face in the direction. The
expression of his great hungry eyes was malevolent.
Whatever moral fear might have been his, there could
be no doubt that he would carry his purpose out.
He gripped his pistol firmly and moved towards the
door.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></div>
<p>As his hand rested on the latch he paused. Just
for one instant he hesitated. It seemed as though all
that was honest in him was making one final appeal
to the evil passions which swayed him. His eyelids
lowered suddenly, as though he could not even face
the dim light of that gloomy interior. It was the
attitude of one who fully realizes the nature of his
actions, of one who shrinks from the light of honest
purpose and prefers the obscure recesses of his own
moral darkness. Then with an effort he pulled himself
together; he gripped his nerve. The next
moment he flung wide the door.</p>
<p>A flood of wintry sunshine suffused the interior of
the dugout. The glare of the crystal white earth was
dazzling to a degree, and the hungry-looking trapper
stood blinking in the light. His pistol was concealed
behind him. The sleigh was before the door. Rainy-Moon
stood on the far side of the path in the act of
hitching the dogs up. One of the animals, the largest
of them all, was already harnessed, the others were
standing or squatting around, held in leash by the
Indian.</p>
<p>When he heard the door open Rainy-Moon looked
up from his work. He was standing with his back to
the precipice which bordered the narrow ledge. His
great stolid face expressed nothing but solemn
gravity. He grunted and turned again to his work.</p>
<p>Like a flash the trapper&#8217;s pistol darted from behind
him, and its report rang out echoing and re-echoing
amongst the surrounding hills. There was an answering
cry of pain from the harnessed dog, and Rainy-Moon
with a yell stood erect to find himself gazing
into the muzzle of the revolver. The expression of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
the trapper&#8217;s face was relentless now. His first shot
had been fired under the influence of excitement, and
he had missed his object and only wounded the dog.
Now it was different.</p>
<p>Again the pistol rang out. Rainy-Moon gave one
sharp cry of pain and sprang backwards&ndash;&ndash;into space.
In one hand he still gripped the leashes of the dogs.
The other clutched wildly at the air. For one instant
his fall was broken by his hold upon the four dogs,
then the suddenness of his precipitation and his
weight told, and the poor beasts were dragged over
the side of the chasm after him.</p>
<p>The whole dastardly act was but the work of a
moment.</p>
<p>The next all was silence save for the yelping of the
wounded dog lying upon the snow.</p>
<p>The trapper stood for a moment framed in the
doorway. The horror of his crime was upon him.
He waited for a sound to come up to him from below.
He longed to, but he dared not, look over the side of
the yawning chasm. He feared what awful sight his
eyes might encounter. His imagination conjured up
pictures that turned him sick in the stomach, and
a great dread came over him. Suddenly he turned
back into the hut and slammed the door.</p>
<p>The wounded dog had not changed its attitude.
The moments sped by. Suddenly the poor beast
began to struggle violently. It was a huge specimen
of the husky breed, exceptionally powerful and wolfish
in its appearance. The wretched brute moaned
incessantly, but its pain only made it struggle the
harder to free itself from its harness. At length it
succeeded in wriggling out of the primitive &#8220;breast-draw&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
which held it. Then the suffering beast
limped painfully away down the path. Fifty yards
from the hut it squatted upon its haunches and began
to lick its wounded foot. And every now and then it
would cease its healing operation to throw up its long
muzzle and emit one of those drawn-out howls, so
dismal and dispiriting, in which dogs are able to
express their melancholy feelings.</p>
<p>At length the hut door opened again and the
trapper came out; he was equipped for a long journey.
Thick blanket chaps covered his legs, and a great
fur coat reached to his knees. His head was buried
beneath a beaver cap, which, pressed low down over
his ears, was overlapped by the collar of his coat.
He carried a roll of blankets over his shoulder and
a pack on his back. As he came out into the sunshine
he looked fearfully about him. There stood the
loaded sleigh quite undisturbed. The harness alone
was tumbled about by reason of the wounded dog&#8217;s
struggles. And there was a pool of canine blood
upon the snow, and a faint trail of sanguinary hue
leading from it. The man eyed this and followed its
direction until he saw the dog crouching down further
along the path. But he was not thinking of the dog.
He turned back to the sleigh, and his eyes wandered
across, beyond it, to the brink of the precipice. The
only marks that had disturbed the smooth white edge
of the path were those which had tumbled the snow
where the dogs had been dragged to their fate.
Otherwise there was no sign.</p>
<p>The man stepped forward as though to look down
to the depths below, but, as he neared the edge, he
halted shudderingly. Nor did his eyes turn downwards,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
he looked around him, above him&ndash;&ndash;but not
down. He gazed long and earnestly at the hard,
cold, cloudless sky. His brow frowned with unpleasant
thought. Then his lips moved, and he
muttered words that sounded as though he were
endeavouring to justify his acts to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;The gold was mine&ndash;&ndash;honestly mine. It was
wrested from me. It may be Christian to submit
without retaliation. It is not human. What is a
neche&#8217;s life&ndash;&ndash;nothing. Pooh! An Indian life is of
no value in this country. Come on, let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke as though he were not alone. Perhaps
he was addressing that moral self of his which kept
reminding him of his misdeeds. Anyhow, he was
uncomfortable, and his words told of it.</p>
<p>He stooped and adjusted his snow-shoes, after
which he gripped his long staff and slowly began his
journey down the hill.</p>
<p>He quickly got into his stride, that forward, leaning
attitude of the snow-shoer; nor did he glance to the
left or right.</p>
<p>Straight ahead of him he stared, over the jagged
rampart of mountains to the clear steely hue of the
sky above. He was leaving the scene of his crime;
he wished also to leave its memory. He gave no
heed to the trail of blood that stained the whiteness
of the snow beneath his feet; his thoughts were not
of the present&ndash;&ndash;his present; his mind was travelling
swiftly beyond. The whining of the dog as he passed
him fell upon ears that were deaf to all entreaty.</p>
<p>The crystal-covered earth glided by him; the long,
reaching stride of the expert snow-shoer bore him
rapidly along.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></div>
<p>He paused in the valley below and took fresh
bearings. He intended to strike through the heart of
the mountains. The Pass was his goal, for he knew
that there lay the main trail he sought.</p>
<p>He cast about for the landmarks which he had
located during his long tenancy of the dugout. Not
a branch of a tree rustled. Not a breath of air
fanned the steaming breath which poured from his
lips. His mind was centred on his object, but the
nervous realization of loneliness was upon him.</p>
<p>Suddenly the awful stillness was broken. The
man bent his head in a listening attitude. The
sound came from behind and he turned sharply.
His movement was hurried and anxious. His nerves
were not steady. A long-drawn-out wail rose upon
the air. Fifty yards behind stood the wounded hound
gazing after him as if he, too, were endeavouring to
ascertain the right direction. The creature was standing
upon three legs, the fourth was hanging useless,
and the blood was dripping from the footless limb.</p>
<p>The man turned away with an impatient shrug and
stepped out briskly. He knew his direction now, and
resolutely centred his thoughts upon his journey.
Past experience told him that this would tax all his
energy and endurance, and that he must keep a clear
head, for he was not a native of the country, nor had
he the instinct of one whose life had been passed in a
mountainous world. Once he turned at the sound of
a plaintive whining, and, to his annoyance, he saw
that the dog was following him. A half-nervous
laugh escaped him, but he did not pause. He had
hitherto forgotten the creature, and this was an
unpleasant reminder.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></div>
<p>An hour passed. The exhilarating exercise had
cleansed the atmosphere of the murderer&#8217;s thoughts.
Once only he looked back over his shoulder as some
memory of the dog flashed across his brain. He
could see nothing but the immaculate gleam of snow.
Something of the purity of his surroundings seemed
to communicate itself to his thoughts. He found
himself looking forward to a life, the honest, respectable
life, which the burden he carried in his pack
would purchase for him. He saw himself the owner
of vast tracts of pasture, with stock grazing upon it,
a small but comfortable house, and a wife. He
pictured to himself the joys of a pastoral life, a
community in which his opinions and influence would
be matters of importance. He would be looked up
to, and gradually, as his wealth grew, he would
become interested in the world of politics, and he
would&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>He was dragged back to the present by a memory
of the scene at the dugout, and quite suddenly he
broke into a cold perspiration. He increased his
pace, nor did those pleasant visions again return to
him. It was well past noon when at last he halted
for food and rest.</p>
<p>He devoured his simple fare ravenously, but he
gained no enjoyment therefrom. He was moody.
At that moment he hated life; he hated himself for
his weak yielding to the pricks of conscience; he
hated the snow and ice about him for their deadening
effect upon the world through which he was passing;
he hated the dreadful solitude with which he was
surrounded.</p>
<p>Presently he drew out a pipe. He looked at it for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
one instant, then raised it to his nose. He smelt it,
and, with a motion of disgust and a bitter curse, he
threw it from him. It reeked of the weed he had
found at the dugout.</p>
<p>Now he was seized with a feverish restlessness
and was about to rise to his feet. Suddenly, out
on the still, biting air wailed the familiar long-drawn
note of misery. To his disturbed fancy it
came like a dreadful signal of some awful doom.
It echoed in undulating waves of sound, dying
away hardly, as though it were loth to leave its
mournful surroundings. He turned in the direction
whence it proceeded, and slowly into view limped
the wounded husky, yelping piteously at every
step.</p>
<p>At that moment the man was scarcely responsible
for what he did. He was beside himself with dread.
The solitude was on his nerves, this haunting dog, his
own reflections, all had combined to reduce him to
the verge of nervous prostration. With the last
dying sound his heavy revolver was levelled in the
direction of the oncoming hound. There was a
moment&#8217;s pause, then a shot rang out and the dog
stood quite still. The bullet fell short and only
kicked up the snow some yards in front of the
animal, nor did the beast display the least sign of
fear. The man prepared to take another shot, but,
as he was about to fire, his arm dropped to his
side, and, with a mirthless laugh, he put the pistol
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;The d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;d cur seems to know the range of a
gun,&#8221; he muttered, with an uneasy look at the
motionless creature. His words were an apology to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
himself, although perhaps he would not have admitted
it.</p>
<p>The dog remained in its rigid attitude. Its head
was slightly lowered, and its wicked grey eyes glared
ferociously. Its thick mane bristled, and it looked
like a gaunt, hungry wolf following upon the trail of
some unconscious traveller. So long as the man
stood, so long did the dog remain still and silent.
But as the former returned to his seat, and began to
pack up, the dog began to whine and furtively draw
nearer.</p>
<p>Although he did not look up the man knew that
the animal was coming towards him. When he had
finished packing he straightened himself; the dog
was within a few paces of him. He called gently,
and the animal responded with a whimper, but remained
where it was. Its canine mind was evidently
dubious, and the man was forced to take the initiative.
Whatever may have been his intention in the first
place, he now exhibited a curious display of feeling
for one who could plan and perpetrate so dastardly a
crime as that which he had committed at the dugout.
Human nature is a strange blending of good and evil
passions. Two minutes ago the man would, without
the least remorse, have shot the dog. Now as he
reached him, and he listened to the beast&#8217;s plaintive
cries, he stretched out his arm and stroked its
trembling sides, and then stooped to examine the
wounded limb. And, stranger still, he tore off a
portion of the woollen scarf that circled his waist
and proceeded to bandage up the shattered member.
The dog submitted to the operation with languid
resignation. The foot of one hind leg had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
entirely torn away by a revolver shot, and only the
stump of the leg was left. The poor beast would go
on three legs for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>When the man had finished he rose to his feet, and
a bitter laugh shocked the silence of the snow-bound
world.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, you miserable cur. It&#8217;s better like that
than to get the cold into it. I&#8217;ve had some; besides,
I didn&#8217;t intend to damage you. If you&#8217;re going to
travel with me you&#8217;d best come along, and be d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;-d
to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he walked back to where his pack and blankets
lay, and the dog limped at his heels.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>&#8216;YELLOW BOOMING&ndash;&ndash;SLUMP IN GREY&#8217;</h3>
</div>
<p>The days are long since gone when the name of
the midland territory of the great Canadian world,
Manitoba, suggested to the uninitiated nothing but
Red Indians, buffalo and desperadoes of every sort
and condition. Now-a-days it is well known, even
in remote parts of the world, as one of the earth&#8217;s
greatest granaries; a land of rolling pastures, golden
cornfields and prosperous, simple farm folk. In a
short space of time, little more than a quarter of a
century, this section of the country has been elevated
from the profound obscurity of a lawless wilderness
to one of the most thriving provinces of a great
dominion. The old Fort Garry, one of the oldest
factories of the Hudson&#8217;s Bay Company, has given
place to the magnificent city of Winnipeg, with its
own University, its own governing assembly, its
own clubs, hotels, its own world-wide commercial
interests, besides being the great centre of railway
traffic in the country. All these things, and many
other indications of splendid prosperity too numerous
to mention, have grown up in a little over twenty-five
years. And with this growth the buffalo has gone,
the red-man has been herded on to a limited reservation,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
and the &#8220;Bad-man&#8221; is almost an unknown
quantity. Such is the Manitoba of to-day.</p>
<p>But during the stages of Manitoba&#8217;s transition its
history is interesting. The fight between law and
lawlessness was long and arduous, the pitched battles
many and frequent. Buffalo could be killed off
quickly, the red-man was but a poor thing after the
collapse of the Riel rebellion, but the &#8220;Bad-man&#8221;
died hard.</p>
<p>This is the period in the history of Manitoba which
at present interests us. When Winnipeg was building
with a rapidity almost rivalling that of the second
Chicago, and the army of older farmers in the land
was being hastily augmented by recruits from the
mother country. When the military police had withdrawn
their forces to the North-West Territories,
leaving only detachments to hold the American
border against the desperadoes which both countries
were equally anxious to be rid of.</p>
<p>In the remote south-eastern corner of the province,
forty-five miles from the nearest town&ndash;&ndash;which happened
to be the village of Ainsley&ndash;&ndash;dumped down on the
crest of a far-reaching ocean-like swell of rolling
prairie, bare to the blast of the four winds except for
the insignificant shelter of a small bluff on its northeastern
side, stood a large farm-house surrounded by
a small village of barns and outbuildings. It was a
typical Canadian farm of the older, western type.
One of those places which had grown by degrees
from the one central hut of logs, clay and thatch to
the more pretentious proportions of the modern frame
building of red pine weather-boarding, with shingled
roofing to match, and the whole coloured with paint
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
of a deep, port-wine hue, the points and angles being
picked out with a dazzling white. It was a farm, let
there be no mistake, and not merely a homestead.</p>
<p>There were abundant signs of prosperity in the
trim, well-groomed appearance of the place. The
unmistakable hall-mark was to be found in the
presence of a steam-thresher, buried beneath a covering
of tarpaulin and snow, in the array of farming
machinery, and in the maze of pastures enclosed by
top-railed, barbed-wire fencing. All these things,
and the extent of the buildings, told of years of ceaseless
industry and thrift, of able management and a
proper pride in the vocation of its owner.</p>
<p>Nor were these outward signs in any way misleading.
Silas Malling in his lifetime had been
one of those sound-minded men, unimaginative and
practical, the dominant note of whose creed had
always been to do his duty in that state of life in
which he found himself. The son of an early pioneer
he had been born to the life of a farmer, and, having
the good fortune to follow in the footsteps of a thrifty
father, he had lived long enough to see his farm grow
to an extent many times larger and more prosperous
than that of any neighbour within a radius of a
hundred miles. But at the time of our story he had
been gathered to his forefathers for nearly three years,
and his worthy spouse, Hephzibah Malling, reigned in
his stead. She ruled with an equally practical hand,
and fortune had continued to smile upon her. Her
bank balance had grown by leaps and bounds, and
she was known to be one of the richest women in
Southern Manitoba, and her only daughter, Prudence,
to be heiress to no inconsiderable fortune. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
was a son in the family, but he had eschewed the farm
life, and passing out of the home circle, as some
sons will, had gone into the world to seek his own
way&ndash;&ndash;his own experiences of life.</p>
<p>In spite of the wealth of the owners of Loon Dyke
Farm they were very simple, unpretentious folk.
They lived the life they had always known, abiding
by the customs of childhood and the country to
which they belonged with the whole-hearted regard
which is now becoming so regrettably rare. Their
world was a wholesome one which provided them
with all they needed for thought, labour and recreation.
To journey to Winnipeg, a distance of a
hundred and twenty-six miles, was an event which
required two days&#8217; preparation and as many weeks
of consideration. Ainsley, one of those little border
villages which dot the international boundary dividing
Canada from the United States, was a place rarely
visited by them, and when undertaken the trip was
regarded as a notable jaunt.</p>
<p>Just now Mrs. Malling was a prey to the wildest
excitement. An event was about to happen which
disturbed her to a degree. It is doubtful as to what
feeling was uppermost in her motherly bosom. She
was torn between many conflicting emotions&ndash;&ndash;joy,
grief, pleasurable excitement. Her daughter, her
only child, as she was wont to confide to her matronly
friends&ndash;&ndash;for her boy, whom she loved as only a mother
can love a son, she believed she would never see
again&ndash;&ndash;was about to be married.</p>
<p>No visit to town, not even a sea voyage across the
ocean could possibly compare with this. It was a
more significant event in her life even than when she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
went into Winnipeg to choose the monument which
was to be erected over the grave of her departed
Silas. That she had always had in her mind&#8217;s eye,
not because she looked forward to his demise, but
because she hoped some day to share with him its
sheltering canopy. But somehow this forthcoming
marriage of her daughter was in the nature of a shock
to her. She was not mercenary, far from it, she was
above any such motive as that, but she had hoped,
when the time came for such matters to be considered,
that Prudence would have married a certain
rancher who lived out by the Lake of the Woods, a
man of great wealth, and a man whom Mrs. Malling
considered desirable in every way. Instead of that
Prudence had chosen for herself amongst her many
suitors, and worst of all she had chosen an insignificant
official in the Customs department. That
to Hephzibah Malling was the worst blow of all.
With proper motherly pride she had hoped that &#8220;her
girl&#8221; would have married a &#8220;some one&#8221; in her own
world.</p>
<p>The winter evening shadows&ndash;&ndash;it was the middle of
January and winter still held sway upon the prairie&ndash;&ndash;were
falling, and the parlour at the farm was enveloped
in a grey dusk. The room was large, low-ceiled, and
of irregular shape.</p>
<p>It was furnished to serve many purposes, principally
with a view to solid comfort. There was no blatant
display of wealth, and every article of furniture bore
signs of long though careful use. The spotless boarded
floor was bare of carpet, but was strewn with rough-cured
skins, timber-wolf, antelope, coyote and bear,
and here and there rugs of undoubted home make;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
these latter of the patchwork order. The centre
table was of wide proportions and of solid mahogany,
and told of the many services of the apartment; the
small chairs were old-fashioned mahogany pieces
with horse-hair seats, while the easy-chairs&ndash;&ndash;and
there were several of these&ndash;&ndash;were capacious and of
divers descriptions. A well-worn sofa was stowed
away in an obscure angle, and a piano with a rose-silk
front and fretwork occupied another of the many
dark corners which the room possessed.</p>
<p>The whole atmosphere of the place was of extreme
comfort. The bare description of furniture conveys
nothing, but the comfort was there and showed out
in the odds and ends of family possessions which
were in evidence everywhere&ndash;&ndash;the grandfather&#8217;s clock,
the sewing-machine, the quaint old oil-lamps upon
the mantel-board over the place where the fire should
have been but was not; the soft hangings and curious
old family pictures and discoloured engravings; the
perfect femininity of the room. In all respects it was
a Canadian farm &#8220;best parlour.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were four occupants of the room. Two old
ladies, rotund, and garbed in modest raiment of some
sort of dark, clinging material, were gathered about
the monster self-feeding stove, seated in arm-chairs
in keeping with their ample proportions. One was
the widow of the late Silas Malling, and the other
was the school-ma&#8217;am from the Leonville school-house.
This good lady rejoiced in the name of
Gurridge, and Mrs. Gurridge was the oldest friend
of Hephzibah Malling, a fact which spoke highly
for the former good dame&#8217;s many excellent qualities.
Hephzibah was not a woman to set her affections
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
on her sex without good reason. Her moral standard
was high, and though she was ever ready to
show kindliness to her fellow-creatures, she was
far too practical and honest herself to take to her
motherly bosom any one who was not worthy of
regard.</p>
<p>As was natural, they were talking of the forthcoming
marriage, and the tone of their lowered voices
indicated that their remarks were in the nature of
confidences. Mrs. Malling was sitting bolt upright,
and her plump, rather rough hands were folded in her
broad lap. Mrs. Gurridge was leaning towards the
stove, gazing into the fire through the mica sides of
the fire-box.</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust they will be happy,&#8221; said Mrs. Gurridge,
with a sigh. Then as an afterthought: &#8220;He seems
all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Mrs. Malling said, with a responsive exhalation,
&#8220;I think so. He has few faults. But he is not
the man to follow my Silas on this farm. I truly
believe, Sarah, that he couldn&#8217;t tell the difference
between a cabbage-field and a potato-patch. These
what-d&#8217;you-call-&#8217;ems, Civil servants, are only fit to
tot up figures and play around with a woman&#8217;s wardrobe
every time she crosses the border. Thank
goodness I&#8217;m not of the travelling kind; I&#8217;m sure I
should hide my face for very shame every time I saw
a Customs officer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The round, rosy face of the farm-wife assumed a
deeper hue, and her still comely lips were pursed into
an indignant <i>moue</i>. Her smooth grey head, adorned
by a black lace cap trimmed with pearl beads, was
turned in the direction of the two other occupants of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
the room, who were more or less buried in the
obscurity of a distant corner.</p>
<p>For a moment she gazed at the dimly-outlined
figure of a man who was seated on one of the horse-hair
chairs, leaning towards the sofa on which
reclined the form of her daughter, Prudence. His
elbows were resting on his knees and his chin was
supported upon his two clenched fists. He was
talking earnestly. Mrs. Malling watched him for
some moments, then her eyes drifted to the girl, the
object of her solicitude.</p>
<p>Although the latter was in the shadow her features
were, even at this distance, plainly discernible.
There was a strong resemblance between mother and
daughter. They were both of medium dark complexion,
with strong colouring. Both were possessed
of delightfully sweet brown eyes, and mouths and
chins firm but shapely. The one remarkable difference
between them was in the nasal organ. While
the mother&#8217;s was short, well-rounded, and what one
would call pretty though ordinary, the girl&#8217;s was
prominent and aquiline with a decided bridge. This
feature gave the younger woman a remarkable
amount of character to her face. Altogether hers was
a face which, wherever she went, would inevitably
attract admiring attention. Just now she was
evidently teasing the man before her, and the mother
turned back to the stove with a merry twinkle in her
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Prudence will teach him a few lessons,&#8221;
she murmured to her friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&ndash;&ndash;about the farm?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I wasn&#8217;t just thinking of the farm.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></div>
<p>The two ladies smiled into each other&#8217;s faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is a good child,&#8221; observed Mrs. Gurridge
affectionately, after awhile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or she wouldn&#8217;t be her father&#8217;s child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or your daughter, Hephzibah,&#8221; said Sarah
Gurridge sincerely.</p>
<p>The two relapsed into silence. The glowing coals
in the stove shook lower and received augmentation
from the supply above. Darkness was drawing on.</p>
<p>Prudence was holding the <i>Free Press</i> out towards
the dying light and the man was protesting. The
latter is already known to us. His name was Leslie
Grey, now an under-official of the Customs department
at the border village of Ainsley.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t strain your eyes in this light, dear,&#8221; he was
saying. &#8220;Besides, I want to talk to you.&#8221; He laid his
hand upon the paper to take it from her. But the
girl quickly withdrew it out of his reach.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must let me look at the personal column,
Leslie,&#8221; she said teasingly, &#8220;I just love it. What do
you call it? The &#8216;Agony&#8217; column, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the man answered, with some show of irritation.
&#8220;But I want&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you do,&#8221; the girl interrupted. &#8220;You
want to talk to me&ndash;&ndash;very right and proper. But
listen to this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grey bit his lip. Prudence bent her face close to
the paper and read in a solemn whisper&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yellow booming&ndash;&ndash;slump in Grey&#8217;! Now I wonder
what that means? Do you think it&#8217;s a disguised
love message to some forlorn damsel in the east, or
does it conceal the heartrending cry of a lost soul to
some fond but angry parent?&#8221; Then, as the man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
did not immediately answer, she went on with a
pucker of thought upon her brow. &#8220;&#8216;Yellow&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;that
might mean gold. &#8216;Booming&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;ah, yes, the Kootenai
mines, or the Yukon. There is going to be a rush
there this year, isn&#8217;t there? Oh, I forgot,&#8221; with real
contrition, &#8220;I mustn&#8217;t mention the Yukon, must I?
That is where your disaster occurred that caused
you to be banished to the one-horsed station of
Ainsley.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not forgetting the reduction of my salary to the
princely sum of two thousand dollars per annum,&#8221;
Grey added bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, old boy, it brought us together, and
dollars aren&#8217;t likely to trouble us any. But let me
get on with my puzzle. &#8216;Slump in Grey.&#8217; That&#8217;s
funny, isn&#8217;t it? &#8216;Slump&#8217; certainly has to do with
business. I&#8217;ve seen &#8216;Slump&#8217; in the finance columns
of the Toronto <i>Globe</i>. And then &#8216;Grey.&#8217; That&#8217;s
your name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um. Guess I can&#8217;t make much of it. Seems to
me it must be some business message. I call it real
disappointing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not so disappointing as you think, sweetheart,&#8221;
Grey said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;What, do you understand it?&#8221; The girl at once
became all interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; slowly, &#8220;I understand it, but I don&#8217;t know
that I ought to tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you must. I&#8217;m just dying of curiosity.
Besides,&#8221; she went on coaxingly, &#8220;we are going to be
married, and it wouldn&#8217;t be right to have any secrets
from me. Dear old Gurridge never lost an opportunity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
of firing sage maxims at us when I used to go to
her school. I think the one to suit this occasion ran
something like this&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8216;Secrets withheld &#8217;twixt man and wife,<br />
Infallibly end in connubial strife.&#8217;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;She always made her rhymes up as she went
along. She&#8217;s a sweet old dear, but so funny.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Grey was not heeding the girl&#8217;s chatter. His
face was serious and his obstinate mouth was tight-shut.
He was gazing with introspective eyes at the
paper which was now lying in the girl&#8217;s lap.
Suddenly he leaned further forward and spoke almost
in a whisper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Prue, I want you to listen seriously to
what I have to say. I&#8217;m not a man given to undue
hopefulness. I generally take my own way in things
and see it through, whether that way is right or
wrong. So far I&#8217;ve had some successes and more
failures. If I were given to dreaming or repining I
should say Fate was dead against me. That last
smasher I came in the mountains, when I lost the
Government bullion, nearly settled me altogether, but,
in spite of it all, I haven&#8217;t given up hope yet, and
what is more, I anticipate making a big coup shortly
which will reinstate me in favour with the heads of
my department. My coup is in connection with the
notice you have just read out from the &#8216;Agony&#8217;
column.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl nodded. She was quite serious now.
Grey paused, and the ticking of the grandfather&#8217;s
clock on the other side of the room pounded heavily
in the twilight The murmur of the old ladies&#8217; voices
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
occasionally reached the lovers, but it did not interrupt
them or divert their attention from their own
affairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;That notice,&#8221; Grey went on, &#8220;has appeared at
regular intervals in the paper, and is a message to
certain agents from a certain man, to say that certain
illicit work has been carried out. I have discovered
who this man is and the nature of his work. It does
not matter who he is or what the work; in fact, it
would be dangerous to mention either, even here;
the point is that I have discovered the secret, and I,
alone, am going to benefit by my discovery. I am
not going to let any one share the reward with me.
I want to reinstate myself with the authorities, and so
regain my lost position, then no one will be able to
say things about my marriage with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one had better say anything against you in my
hearing, anyway, Leslie,&#8221; the girl put in quickly.
&#8220;Because I happen to be rich&ndash;&ndash;or shall be&ndash;&ndash;is nothing
to do with any one but myself. As far as I
can see it will be a blessing. Go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt it is as you say, dear,&#8221; the man pursued;
&#8220;but there are plenty of people unkind enough to
believe that I am marrying you for your money.
However, I am going to get this man red-handed,
and, I tell you, it will be the greatest coup of my
life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you will succeed, Leslie,&#8221; the girl said, her
brown eyes fixed in admiration upon her lover. &#8220;Do
you know, I never thought you were such a determined
fellow,&#8221; she added impulsively. &#8220;Why, I can
almost believe that you&#8217;d learn to farm if you took
the notion.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>Grey&#8217;s sense of humour was not equal to the
occasion, and he took her remark quite seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man must be a fool if he can&#8217;t run a farm,&#8221; he
said roughly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many folks labour under that mistake,&#8221; the girl
replied. Then: &#8220;Say, when are you going to do this
thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Strangely enough, the critical moment will come
two days after our marriage. Let&#8217;s see. This is
Monday. We are to be married to-morrow week.
That will make it Thursday week.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl sat herself up on the sofa, and her
young face expressed dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right in the middle of our honeymoon. Oh,
Leslie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be helped, dearest. I shall only be away
from you for that afternoon and the night. Think
of what it means to me. Everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes.&#8221; She sank back again upon the sofa.
There was the faintest glimmer of a smile in the
depths of her dark eyes. &#8220;I forgot what it meant to
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unconscious irony of her words fell upon
stony ground.</p>
<p>Prudence Malling was deeply in love with Leslie
Grey. How few men fully appreciate the priceless
treasure of a good woman&#8217;s regard.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I bring this off it means immediate promotion,&#8221;
Grey went on, in his blindly selfish way. &#8220;I must
succeed. I hate failure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They will take you off the border, then,&#8221; said the
girl musingly. &#8220;That will mean&ndash;&ndash;leaving here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which also means a big step up.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Of course&ndash;&ndash;it will mean a big step up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl sighed. She loved the farm; that home
which she had always known. She changed the
subject suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be nearly tea-time. We are going to
have tea early, Leslie, so that we can get through
with it comfortably before the people come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes, I forgot you are having a &#8216;Progressive
Euchre&#8217; party to-night. What time does it begin?
I mean the party.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven o&#8217;clock. But you are going to stay to
tea?&#8221;</p>
<p>Grey glanced up at the yellow face of the grandfather&#8217;s
clock and shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid not, little girl. I&#8217;ve got some work to do
in connection with Thursday week. I will drop in
about nine o&#8217;clock. Who&#8217;re coming?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it really necessary, this work?&#8221; There was a
touch of bitterness in Prudence&#8217;s voice. But the next
moment she went on cheerfully. She would not
allow herself to stand in her lover&#8217;s way. &#8220;The usual
people are coming. It will be just our monthly
gathering of neighbouring&ndash;&ndash;moss-backs,&#8221; with a laugh.
&#8220;The Turners, the Furrers&ndash;&ndash;Peter Furrers, of course;
he still hopes to cut you out&ndash;&ndash;and the girls; old
Gleichen and his two sons, Harry and Tim. And the
Ganthorns from Rosebank and their cousins the
Covills of Lakeville. And&ndash;&ndash;I almost forgot him&ndash;&ndash;mother&#8217;s
flame, George Iredale of Lonely Ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Iredale coming? It&#8217;s too bad of you to have
him here, Prue. Your mother&#8217;s flame&ndash;&ndash;um, I like
that. Why, he&#8217;s been after you for over three years.
It&#8217;s not right to ask him when I am here, besides&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
Grey broke off abruptly. Darkness hid the angry
flush which had spread over his face. The girl knew
he was angry. His tone was raised, and there was
no mistaking Leslie Grey&#8217;s anger. He was very
nearly a gentleman, but not quite.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I have a perfect right to ask him, Leslie,&#8221;
she answered seriously. &#8220;His coming can make no
possible difference to you. Frankly, I like him, but
that makes no difference to my love for you. Why,
you dear, silly thing, if he asked me from now till
Doomsday I wouldn&#8217;t marry him. He&#8217;s just a real
good friend. But still, if it will please you, I don&#8217;t
mind admitting that mother insisted on his coming,
and that I had nothing to do with it. That is why
I call him mother&#8217;s flame. Now, then, take that
ugly frown off your face and say you&#8217;re sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grey showed no sign of obedience; he was very
angry. It was believed and put about by the busy-bodies
of the district, that George Iredale had sought
Prudence Malling in marriage ever since she had
grown up. He was a bachelor of close upon forty.
One of those quiet, determined men, slow of speech,
even clumsy, but quick to make up their minds, and
endowed with a great tenacity of purpose. A man
who rarely said he was going to do a thing, but
generally did it. These known features in a man who,
up to the time of the announcement of Prudence&#8217;s
engagement to Grey, had been a frequent visitor to
the farm, and who was also well known to be wealthy
and more than approved of by Mrs. Malling, no
doubt, gave a certain amount of colour to the belief of
those who chose to pry into their neighbours&#8217; affairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway I don&#8217;t think there is room for both
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
Iredale and myself in the house,&#8221; Grey went on
heatedly. &#8220;If you didn&#8217;t want him you should have
put your foot down on your mother&#8217;s suggestion. I
don&#8217;t think I shall come to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>For one moment the girl looked squarely into her
lover&#8217;s face and her pretty lips drew sharply together.
Then she spoke quite coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will&ndash;&ndash;or I&#8217;ll never speak to you again. You
are very foolish to make such a fuss.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was along silence between the lovers. Then
Grey drew out his watch, opened it, glanced at the
time, and snapped it closed again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go,&#8221; he said shortly.</p>
<p>Prudence had risen from the sofa. She no longer
seemed to heed her lover. She was looking across
the darkened room at the homely picture round the
glowing stove.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she said. And she moved away from
the man&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>The two old ladies pausing in their conversation
heard Grey&#8217;s announcement and the answer Prudence
made. Sarah Gurridge leaned towards her companion
with a confidential movement of the head.
The two grey heads came close together.</p>
<p>The school-ma&#8217;am whispered impressively&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;&#8216;Maid who angers faithful swain<br />

</td></tr></table>
<p>Hephzibah laughed tolerantly. Sarah&#8217;s earnestness
never failed to amuse her.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; the girl&#8217;s mother murmured back, when
her comfortable laugh had gurgled itself out, &#8220;young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
folks must skit-skat and bicker, or where would be
the making up? La, I&#8217;m sure when I was a girl I
used to tweak my poor Silas&#8217;s nose for the love of
making him angry&ndash;&ndash;Silas had a long nose, my dear,
as you may remember. Men hate to be tweaked,
especially on their weak points. My Silas was always
silly about his nose. And we never had less than
half-an-hour&#8217;s making up. I wonder how Prudence
has tweaked Mr. Grey&ndash;&ndash;I can&#8217;t bring myself to call
him Leslie, my dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence had reached her mother&#8217;s side. The two
old heads parted with guilty suddenness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear,&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Malling, &#8220;how you
did startle me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, mother,&#8221; the girl said, &#8220;but I wanted to
tell you that Leslie is not coming to-night.&#8221; Prudence
turned a mischievous face towards her lover.</p>
<p>Mrs. Malling wrinkled up her smooth forehead.
She assumed an air of surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not, my child?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, because you have asked Mr. Iredale. Leslie
says it isn&#8217;t right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence was still looking in her lover&#8217;s direction.
He had his back turned. He was more angry than
ever now.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dears,&#8221; said her mother with an indulgent
smile, &#8220;you are a pair of silly noodles. But Mr.
Grey&ndash;&ndash;I mean Leslie&ndash;&ndash;must please himself. George
Iredale is coming because I have asked him. This
house is yours to come and go as you like&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;Leslie.
George Iredale has promised to come to the
cards to-night. Did I hear you say you were going
now? I should have taken it homely if you would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
have stayed to tea. The party begins at seven, don&#8217;t
forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three pairs of quizzical eyes were fixed upon Grey&#8217;s
good-looking but angry face. His anger was against
Prudence entirely now. She had made him look
foolish before these two ladies, and that was not
easily to be forgiven. Grey&#8217;s lack of humour made
him view things in a ponderous light. He felt most
uncomfortable under the laughing gaze of those three
ladies.</p>
<p>However, he would not give way an inch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I must go now,&#8221; he said ungraciously. &#8220;But
not on account of George Iredale,&#8221; he added blunderingly.
&#8220;I have some important work to do&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by a suppressed laugh from
Prudence. He turned upon her suddenly, glared,
then walked abruptly to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; he exclaimed shortly, and the door
closed sharply behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Prudence,&#8221; said Mrs. Malling, turning her
round laughing face to her daughter and indicating
the door. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not, mother dear,&#8221; the girl answered with
a forced laugh.</p>
<p>Sarah Gurridge patted her late pupil&#8217;s shoulder
affectionately. But her head shook gravely as though
a weight of worldly wisdom was hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll stay away,&#8221; said the mother,
with a tender glance in the girl&#8217;s direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t chin enough,&#8221; said Sarah, who prided
herself upon her understanding of physiognomy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed he has,&#8221; retorted Prudence, who heard the
remark.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></div>
<p>Mrs. Malling was right, Leslie Grey was not going
to stay away. He had no intention of doing so. But
his reasons were quite apart from those Hephzibah
Malling attributed to him. He wished to see George
Iredale, and because of the man&#8217;s coming Grey would
forego his angry desire to retaliate upon Prudence.
He quite ignored what he was pleased to call his own
pride in the matter. He would come because he had
what he considered excellent reasons for so doing.</p>
<p>Prudence lit the lamps and laid the table for tea.
Her mother ambled off to the great kitchen as fast as
her bulk would allow her. There were many things
in that wonderful place to see to for the supper, and
on these occasions Mrs. Malling would not trust their
supervision even to Prudence, much less to the hired
girl, Mary. Sarah Gurridge remained in her seat by
the stove watching the glowing coals dreamily, her
mind galloping ahead through fanciful scenes of her
own imagination. Had she been asked she would
probably have stated that she was looking forward into
the future of the pair who were so soon to be married.</p>
<p>Prudence went on quietly and nimbly with her
work. Presently Sarah turned, and after a moment&#8217;s
intent gaze at the trim, rounded figure, said in her
profoundest tone&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;&#8216;Harvest your wheat ere the August frost;<br />

<p>&#8220;Oh, bother&ndash;&ndash;there, I&#8217;ve set a place for Leslie,&#8221;
exclaimed Prudence in a tone of vexation. &#8220;What is
that about &#8216;frost&#8217; and &#8216;lost&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, dear, I was only thinking aloud.&#8221; And
Sarah Gurridge relapsed into silence, and continued
to bask in the warm glow of the stove.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>THE RETURN OF THE PRODIGAL</h3>
</div>
<p>Grey strode away from the house in no very
amiable frame of mind. A fenced-in patch, planted
with blue-gums and a mass of low-growing shrubs,
formed a sort of garden in front of the farm.</p>
<p>This enclosure was devoid of all artistic effect,
but in summer-time it served as a screen to break
the rigour of the wooden farm-buildings. It was a
practical but incongruous piece of man&#8217;s handiwork,
divided down the centre by a pathway bordered with
overlapped hoopings of bent red willow switches,
which, even in winter, protruded hideously above the
beaten snow. The path led to a front gate of
primitive and bald manufacture, but stout and serviceable,
as was everything else about the farm. And
this was the main approach to the house.</p>
<p>It was necessary for Grey, having taken his
departure by the front door, to pass out through this
gate in order to reach the barn where he had left his
saddle-horse. He might have saved himself this
trouble by leaving the house by the back door, which
opened out directly opposite the entrance to the great
barn. But he was in no mood for back doors; the
condition of his mind demanded nothing less than a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
dignified exit, and a dignified exit is never compatible
with a back door. Had he left Loon Dyke Farm in
an amiable frame of mind, much that was to happen
in his immediate future might have been different.</p>
<p>But the writing had been set forth, and there was
no altering it.</p>
<p>He walked with a great show of unnecessary
energy. It was his nature to do so. His energy was
almost painful to behold. Too much vigour and
energy is almost worse than chronic indolence; sooner
or later people so afflicted find themselves in
difficulties.</p>
<p>It was more than a year since his misadventure in
the mountains. He had suffered for his own wrong-headedness
over that matter, but he had not profited
by his experience; he was incapable of doing so. His
length of service and reputation for hard work had
saved him from dismissal, but Chillingwood was less
fortunate; subordinates in Government service generally
are less fortunate when their superiors blunder.</p>
<p>However, Grey had outlived that unpleasantness.
He was not the man to brood over disaster. Soon
after he had been transferred to Ainsley the Town
Clerkship fell vacant. He did what he could for
Chillingwood, with the result that the younger man
eventually secured the post, and thus found himself
enjoying a bare existence on an income of $500 per
annum.</p>
<p>Halfway down the path Grey became aware of a
horseman approaching the farm. The figure was
moving along slowly over the trail from Ainsley. In
the dusk the horse appeared to be jaded; its head
hung down, and its gait was ambling. The stranger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
was tall, but beyond that Grey could see nothing,
for the face was almost entirely hidden in the depths
of the storm-collar of his coat. The officer looked
hard at the new-comer. It was part of his work
to know, at least by sight, every inhabitant of his
district. This man was quite a stranger to him.
The horse was unknown to him, and the fur coat was
unfamiliar. In winter these things usually mark a
man out to his acquaintances. The horse shows up
against the snow, and the prairie man does not usually
possess two fur coats.</p>
<p>On the stranger&#8217;s first appearance Grey&#8217;s thoughts
had at once flown to George Iredale, but now, as he
realized that the man was unknown to him, his
interest relaxed. However, he walked slowly on to
the gate so that he might obtain a closer inspection.
Horse and rider were about twenty-five yards off
when Grey reached the gate, and he saw that they
were followed at some distance by a great wolfish-looking
hound.</p>
<p>The evening shadows had grown rapidly. The
grey vault of snow-clouds above made the twilight
much darker than usual. Grey waited. The traveller
silently drew up his horse, and for a moment sat
gazing at the figure by the gate. All that was
visible of his face was the suggestion of a nose and
a pair of large dark eyes.</p>
<p>Grey opened the gate and passed out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evening,&#8221; said the horseman, in a voice muffled by
the fur of his coat-collar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-evening,&#8221; replied Grey shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Loon Dyke Farm,&#8221; said the stranger, in a tone less
of inquiry than of making a statement.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>Grey nodded, and turned to move away. Then he
seemed to hesitate, and turned again to the stranger.
Those eyes! Where had he seen just such a pair of
eyes before? He tried to think, but somehow his
memory failed him. The horseman had turned his
face towards the house and so the great roving eyes
were hidden. But Grey was too intent upon the
business he had in hand to devote much thought to
anything else.</p>
<p>There was no further reason for remaining; he had
satisfied his curiosity. He would learn all about the
stranger later on.</p>
<p>He hurried round to the stables. When he had
gone the stranger dismounted; for a moment or two
he stood with one hand on the gate and the other
holding the horse&#8217;s reins, gazing after the retreating
form of the Customs officer. He waited until the
other had disappeared, then leisurely hitched his
horse&#8217;s reins on to the fence of the enclosure, and,
passing in through the gate, approached the house.
Presently he saw Grey ride away, and a close observer
might have detected the sound of a heavy sigh
escaping from between the embracing folds of the fur
collar as the man walked up the path and rapped
loudly upon the front door with his mitted fist. The
three-footed hound had closed up on his master, and
now stood beside him.</p>
<p>Prudence opened the door. Tea was just ready;
and she answered the summons, half expecting to
find that her lover had thought better of his ill-humour
and had returned to share the evening meal.
She drew back well within the house when she
realized her mistake. The stranger stood for one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
second as though in doubt; then his voice reached the
waiting girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prudence, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl started. Then a smile broke over her
pretty, dark face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s Hervey&ndash;&ndash;brother Hervey. Here,
mother,&#8221; she called back into the house. &#8220;Quick,
here&#8217;s Hervey. Why, you dear boy, I didn&#8217;t expect
you for at least a week&ndash;&ndash;and then I wasn&#8217;t sure you
would come. You got my letter safely then, and you
must have started off almost at once&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;re a real
good brother to come so soon. Yes, in here; tea is
just ready. Take off your coat. Come along,
mother,&#8221; she called out again joyously. &#8220;Hurry; come
as fast as you can; Hervey is here.&#8221; And she ran
away towards the kitchen. Her mother&#8217;s movements
were far too slow to suit her.</p>
<p>The man removed his coat, and voices reached him
from the direction of the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dearie me, but, child, you do rush one about so.
Where is he? There, you&#8217;ve left the door open; and
whose is that hideous brute of a dog? Why, it looks
like a timber-wolf. Send him out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Malling talked far more rapidly than she
walked, or rather trotted, under the force of her
daughter&#8217;s bustling excitement. Hervey went out
into the hall to meet her. Standing framed in the
doorway he saw his dog.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out, you brute,&#8221; he shouted, and stepping
quickly up to the animal he launched a cruel kick at
it which caught it squarely on the chest. The beast
turned solemnly away without a sound, and Hervey
closed the door.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></div>
<p>The mother was the first to meet him. Her stout
arms were outstretched, while her face beamed with
pride, and her eyes were filled with tears of joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear, dear boy,&#8221; she exclaimed, smiling
happily. Hervey made no reciprocal movement.
He merely bent his head down to her level and
allowed her to kiss his cheek. She hugged him
forcefully to her ample bosom, an embrace from
which he quickly released himself. Her words then
poured forth in a swift, incoherent flow. &#8220;And to
think I believed that I should never see you again.
And how you have grown and filled out. Just like
your father. And where have you been all this time,
and have you kept well? Look at the tan on his
face, Prudence, and the beard too. Why, I should
hardly have known you, boy, if I hadn&#8217;t &#8217;a known
who it was. Why, you must be inches taller than
your father for sure&ndash;&ndash;and he was a tall man. But
you must tell me all about yourself when the folks
are all gone to-night. We are having a party, you
know. And isn&#8217;t it nice?&ndash;&ndash;you will be here for
Prudence&#8217;s wedding&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think we&#8217;d better go into the parlour
instead of standing out here?&#8221; the girl interrupted
practically. Her mother&#8217;s rambling remarks had
shown no sign of cessation, and the tea was waiting.
&#8220;Hervey must be tired and hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I must confess I am utterly worn out,&#8221; the
man replied with a laugh. &#8220;Yes, mother, if tea is
ready let&#8217;s come along. We can talk during the
meal.&#8221;</p>
<p>They passed into the parlour. As they seated
themselves at the table, Sarah Gurridge joined them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
from her place beside the stove. Hervey had not
noticed her presence when he first entered the room,
and the good school-ma&#8217;am, quietly day-dreaming, had
barely awakened to the fact of his coming. Now she,
too, joined in the enthusiasm of the moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Hervey,&#8221; she said, with that complacent air
of proprietorship which our early preceptors invariably
assume, &#8220;you haven&#8217;t forgotten me, I know.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8216;Though the tempest of life will oft shut out the past,<br />
The thoughts of our school-days remain to the last.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;Glad to see you, Mrs. Gurridge. No, I haven&#8217;t
forgotten you,&#8221; the man replied.</p>
<p>A slight pause followed. The women-folk had so
much to say that they hardly knew where to begin.
That trifling hesitation might have been accounted
for by this fact. Or it might have been that Hervey
was less overjoyed at his home-coming than were
his mother and sister.</p>
<p>Prudence was the first to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Funny that I should have set a place more than
I intended at the tea-table,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and funnier
still that when I found out what I&#8217;d done I didn&#8217;t
remove the plate and things. And now you turn up.&#8221;
She laughed joyously.</p>
<p>Sarah Gurridge looked over in the girl&#8217;s direction
and shook an admonitory forefinger at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Grey, my dear&ndash;&ndash;you were thinking of Mr.
Grey, in spite of your lover&#8217;s tiff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who did you say?&#8221; asked Hervey, with a quick
glance at Prudence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leslie Grey,&#8221; said his mother, before the old
school-ma&#8217;am could reply. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t our Prudence tell
you when she wrote? He&#8217;s the man she&#8217;s going to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
marry. I must say he&#8217;s not the man I should have
set on for her; but she&#8217;s got her own ploughing to
seed, and I&#8217;m not the one to say her &#8216;nay&#8217; when she
chooses her man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hervey busied himself with his food, nor did he
look up when he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was Grey, I s&#8217;pose, I saw riding away as I
came up? Good, square-set chunk of a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he left just before you came,&#8221; said Prudence.
&#8220;But never mind about him, brother. Tell us about
yourself. Have you made a fortune?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For sure, he must,&#8221; said their mother, gazing with
round, proud eyes upon her boy, &#8220;for how else came
he to travel from California to here, just to set his
eyes on us and see a slip of a girl take to herself a
husband? My, but it&#8217;s a great journey for a boy to
take.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing to what I&#8217;ve done in my time,&#8221; replied
Hervey. &#8220;Besides, mother, I&#8217;ve got further to go
yet. And as for sister Prudence&#8217;s marriage, I&#8217;m
afraid I can&#8217;t stay for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not stay?&#8221; exclaimed his mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean it?&#8221; asked his sister incredulously.</p>
<p>Sarah Gurridge contented herself with looking her
dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, it&#8217;s like this,&#8221; said Hervey. He had an
uncomfortable habit of keeping his eyes fixed upon
the table, only just permitting himself occasional
swift upward glances over the other folk&#8217;s heads.
&#8220;When I got your letter, Prudence, I was just preparing
to come up from Los Mares to go and see a
big fruit-grower at Niagara. The truth is that my
fruit farm is a failure and I am trying to sell it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></div>
<p>&#8220;My poor boy!&#8221; exclaimed his mother; &#8220;and you
never told me. But there, you were always as proud
as proud, and never would let me help you. Your
poor father was just the same; when things went
wrong he wouldn&#8217;t own up to any one. I remember
how we lost sixty acres of forty-bushel, No. 1 wheat
with an August frost. I never learned it till we&#8217;d
taken in the finest crop in the district at the next
harvesting. But you didn&#8217;t put all your savings into
fruit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I did, mother, worse luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All you made up at the Yukon goldfields?&#8221;
asked Prudence, alarm in her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every cent.&#8221;</p>
<p>There followed a dead silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Mrs. Malling could get no further.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m broke&ndash;&ndash;dead broke. And I&#8217;m going East to
sell my land to pay off my debts. I&#8217;ve had an offer
for it, and I&#8217;m going to clinch the deal quick. Say,
I just came along here to see you, and I&#8217;m going on
at once. I only got into Winnipeg yesterday. I
rode out without delay, but struck the Ainsley trail,
or I should have been here sooner. Now, see here,
mother,&#8221; Hervey went on, as a woe-begone expression
closely verging on tears came into the old dame&#8217;s
eyes, &#8220;it&#8217;s no use crying over this business. What&#8217;s
done is done. I&#8217;m going to get clear of my farm
first, and maybe afterwards I&#8217;ll come here again and
we&#8217;ll talk things over a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence sat staring at her brother, but Hervey
avoided her gaze. Mrs. Malling was too heartbroken
to speak yet. Her weather-tanned face had blanched
as much as it was possible for it to do. Her boy had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
gone out upon the world to seek his fortune, and he
had succeeded in establishing himself, he had written
and told her. He had found gold in quantities in the
Yukon valley, and now&ndash;&ndash;now, at last, he had failed.
The shock had for the moment crushed her; her boy,
her proud independent boy, as she had been wont
to consider him, had failed. She did not ask herself,
or him, the reason of his failure. Such failure, she
felt, must be through no fault of his, but the result of
adverse circumstances.</p>
<p>She never thought of the gambling-table. She
never thought of reckless living. Such things could
not enter her simple mind and be in any way
associated with her boy. Hephzibah Malling loved
her son; to her he was the king who could do no
wrong. She continued to gaze blankly in the man&#8217;s
direction.</p>
<p>Sarah Gurridge alone of the trio allowed herself
sidelong, speculative glances at the man&#8217;s face. She
had seen the furtive overhead glances; the steady
avoidance of the loving observation of his womankind.
She had known Hervey as well, and perhaps just a
shade better than his mother and sister had; and
long since, in his childish school-days, she had detected
a lurking weakness in an otherwise good character.
She wondered now if he had lived to outgrow that
juvenile trait, or had it grown with him, gaining
strength as the greater passions of manhood
developed?</p>
<p>After the first shock of Hervey&#8217;s announcement
had passed, Mrs. Malling sought refuge in the consolation
of her own ability to help her son. He must
never know want, or suffer the least privation. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
could and would give him everything he needed.
Besides, after all, she argued with womanly feeling,
now perhaps she could persuade him to look after the
farm for her; to stay by her side. He should be in
no way dependent. She would install him as manager
at a comfortable salary. The idea pleased her beyond
measure, and it was with difficulty she could keep
herself from at once putting her proposal into words.
However, by a great effort, she checked her enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then when do you think of going East?&#8221; she
asked, with some trepidation. &#8220;You won&#8217;t go at
once, sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I must go at once,&#8221; Hervey replied promptly.
&#8220;That is, to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you will stay to-night,&#8221; said Prudence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but only to get a good long sleep and rest
my horse. I&#8217;m thoroughly worn out. I&#8217;ve been in
saddle since early this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you sent your horse round to the barn?&#8221;
asked Sarah Gurridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no. He&#8217;s hitched to the fence.&#8221; The
observing Sarah had been sure of it.</p>
<p>Prudence rose from her seat and called out to the
hired girl&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary, send out and tell Andy to take the horse
round to the barn. He&#8217;s hitched to the fence.&#8221; Then
she came back. &#8220;You&#8217;ll join our party to-night, of
course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hoity, girl, of course not,&#8221; said their mother.
&#8220;How&#8217;s the lad going to get rest gallivanting with a
lot of clowns who can only talk of &#8216;bowers&#8217; and
&#8216;jokers&#8217;? You think of nothing but &#8216;how-de-doin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
with your neighbours since you&#8217;re going to be married.
Things were different in my day. I&#8217;ll look after
Hervey,&#8221; she continued, turning to her son. &#8220;You
shall have a good night, lad, or my name&#8217;s not
Hephzibah Malling. Maybe you&#8217;ll tell me by and by
what you&#8217;d like to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, mother,&#8221; replied Hervey, with an air
of relief. &#8220;You understand what it is for a man to
need rest. I&#8217;ll just hang around till the folks come, and
then sneak off to bed. You don&#8217;t mind, Prue, do
you? I&#8217;m dead beat, and I want to leave at daybreak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mind?&#8221; answered Prudence; &#8220;certainly not,
Hervey. I should have liked you to meet Mr. Grey,
but you must get your rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; added her mother, &#8220;and as for meeting
Mr. Grey&ndash;&ndash;well, your brother won&#8217;t sicken for want of
seeing him, I&#8217;ll wager. Come along, Hervey, we&#8217;ll go
to the kitchen; Prudence has to get her best parlour
ready for these chattering noodles. And, miss,&#8221; turning
to her daughter with an expression of pretended
severity, &#8220;don&#8217;t forget that I&#8217;ve got a batch o&#8217; layer
cakes in the ice-box, and you&#8217;ve not told me what you
want in the way of drinks. La, young folks never
think of the comforts. I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know what
you&#8217;ll do without your mother, girl. Some o&#8217; these
times your carelessness will get your parties made a
laughing-stock of. Come along, Hervey.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old lady bustled out, bearing her son off in
triumph to the kitchen. She was quite happy again
now. Her scheme for her son&#8217;s welfare had shut out
all thought of his bad news. Most women are like
this; the joy of giving to their own is perhaps the
greatest joy in the life of a mother.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></div>
<p>In the hall they met the flying, agitated figure of
the hired girl, Mary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please, &#8217;m, there&#8217;s such a racket going on by
the barn. There&#8217;s Andy an&#8217; the two dogs fighting
with a great, strange, three-legged dog wot looks like
a wolf. They&#8217;re that mussed up that I don&#8217;t know,
I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that brute Neche of mine,&#8221; said Hervey, with
an imprecation. &#8220;It&#8217;s all right, girl; I&#8217;ll go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hervey rushed out to the barn. The great three-legged
savage was in the midst of a fierce scrimmage.
Two farm dogs were attacking him. They were both
half-bred sheep-dogs. One was making futile attempts
to get a hold upon the stranger, and Neche was
shaking the other as a terrier would shake a rat.
And Andy, the choreman, was lambasting the intruder
with the business end of a two-tine hay-fork, and
shouting frightful curses at him in a strong American
accent.</p>
<p>As Hervey came upon the scene, Neche hurled his
victim from him, either dead or dying, for the dog lay
quite still where it fell upon the snow. Then, impervious
to the onslaught of the choreman, he seized
the other dog.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come out of it, Andy,&#8221; cried Hervey.</p>
<p>The hired man ceased his efforts at once, glad to be
done with the savage. Hervey then ran up to the
infuriated husky, and dealt him two or three terrible
kicks.</p>
<p>The dog turned round instantly. His fangs were
dripping with blood, and he snarled fiercely, his
baleful eyes glowing with ferocity. But he slunk
off when he recognized his assailant, allowing the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
second dog to run for its life, howling with canine
fear.</p>
<p>Andy went over to the dog that was stretched upon
the snow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess &#8217;e&#8217;s done, boss,&#8221; he said, looking up at
Hervey as the latter came over to his side. &#8220;Say,
that&#8217;s about the slickest scrapper round these parts.
Gee-whizz, &#8217;e went fur me like the tail end o&#8217; a
cyclone when I took your plug to the barn. It was
they curs that kind o&#8217; distracted his attention. Mebbe
thar&#8217;s more wolf nor dog in him. Mebbe, I sez.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s a devil-tempered husky,&#8221; said Hervey.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to shoot him one of these days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wa&#8217;al, I do &#8217;lows that it&#8217;s a mercy &#8217;e ain&#8217;t got
no more&#8217;n three shanks. Mackinaw! but he&#8217;s
handy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The four women had watched the scene from the
kitchen door. Hervey came over to where they were
standing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, mother,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Neche has killed
one of your dogs. He&#8217;s a fiend for fighting. I&#8217;ve a
good mind to shoot him now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t go for to do that,&#8221; said his mother.
&#8220;We oughtn&#8217;t to have sent Andy to take your horse.
I expect the beast thought he was doing right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a brute. Curse him!&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence said nothing. Now she moved a little
away from the house and talked to the dog. He was
placidly, and with no show of penitence, lying down
and licking a laceration on one of his front legs. He
occasionally shook his great head, and stained the
snow with the blood which dripped from his fierce-looking
ears. He paused in his operation at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
sound of the girl&#8217;s voice, and looked up. Her tone
was gentle and caressing. Hervey suddenly called to
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go near him. He&#8217;s as treacherous as a
dogone Indian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come back,&#8221; called out her mother.</p>
<p>The girl paid no attention. She called again, and
patted her blue apron encouragingly. The animal
rose slowly to his feet, looked dubiously in her
direction, then, without any display of enthusiasm,
came slowly towards her. His limp added to his
wicked aspect, but he came, nor did he stop until his
head was resting against her dress, and her hand was
caressing his great back. The huge creature seemed
to appreciate the girl&#8217;s attitude, for he made no
attempt to move away. It is probable that this was
the first caress the dog had ever known in all his
savage life.</p>
<p>Hervey looked on and scratched his beard thoughtfully,
but he said nothing more. Mrs. Malling went
back to the kitchen. Sarah Gurridge alone had
anything to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor creature,&#8221; she observed, in tones of deep
pity. &#8220;I wonder how he lost his foot. Is he always
fighting? A poor companion, I should say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hervey laughed unpleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s not so bad. He&#8217;s savage, and all that
But he&#8217;s a good friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, and a deadly enemy. I suppose he&#8217;s very
fond of you. He lets you kick him,&#8221; she added
significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly know&ndash;&ndash;and I must say I don&#8217;t much
care&ndash;&ndash;what his feelings are towards me. Yes, he lets
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
me kick him.&#8221; Then, after a pause, &#8220;But I think he
really hates me.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Hervey turned abruptly and went back into
the kitchen. He preferred the more pleasant atmosphere
of his mother&#8217;s adulation to the serious
reflections of Sarah Gurridge.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>THE PROGRESSIVE EUCHRE PARTY</h3>
</div>
<p>The Mallings always had a good gathering at their
card parties. Such form of entertainment and
dances were the chief winter amusement of these
prairie-bred folks. A twenty-mile drive in a box-sleigh,
clad in furs, buried beneath heavy fur robes,
and reclining on a deep bedding of sweet-smelling
hay, in lieu of seats, made the journey as comfortable
to such people as would the more luxurious brougham
to the wealthy citizen of civilization. There was
little thought of display amongst the farmers of
Manitoba. When they went to a party their primary
object was enjoyment, and they generally contrived to
obtain their desire at these gatherings. Journeys
were chiefly taken in parties; and the amount of
snugness obtained in the bottom of a box-sleigh
would be surprising to those without such experience.
There was nothing <i>blas&eacute;</i> about the simple country
folk. A hard day&#8217;s work was nothing to them. They
would follow it up by an evening&#8217;s enjoyment with
the keenest appreciation; and they knew how to
revel with the best.</p>
<p>The first to arrive at Loon Dyke Farm were the
Furrers. Daisy, Fortune, and Rachel, three girls of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
round proportions, all dressed alike, and of age ranging
in the region of twenty. They spoke well and
frequently; and their dancing eyes and ready laugh
indicated spirits at concert pitch. These three were
great friends of Prudence, and were loud in their
admiration of her. Peter Furrer, their brother, was
with them; he was a red-faced boy of about seventeen,
a giant of flesh, and a pigmy of intellect&ndash;&ndash;outside of
farming operations. Mrs. Furrer accompanied the
party as chaperon&ndash;&ndash;for even in the West chaperons
are recognized as useful adjuncts, and, besides, enjoyment
is not always a question of age.</p>
<p>Following closely on the heels of the Furrers came
old Gleichen and his two sons, Tim and Harry.
Gleichen was a well-to-do &#8220;mixed&#8221; farmer&ndash;&ndash;a
widower who was looking out for a partner as staid
and robust as himself. His two sons were less of the
prairie than their father, by reason of an education at
St. John&#8217;s University in Winnipeg. Harry was an
aspirant to Holy Orders, and already had charge of a
mission in the small neighbouring settlement of Lakeville.
Tim acted as foreman to his father&#8217;s farm; a
boy of enterprising ideas, and who never hesitated to
advocate to his steady-going parent the advantage of
devoting himself to stock-raising.</p>
<p>Others arrived in quick succession; a truly agricultural
gathering. Amongst the latest of the early
arrivals were the Ganthorns; mother, son, and
daughter, pretentious folk of considerable means, and
recently imported from the Old Country.</p>
<p>By half-past seven everybody had arrived with the
exception of George Iredale and Leslie Grey. The
fun began from the very first.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></div>
<p>The dining-table had disappeared from the parlour,
as had the rugs from the floor, and somehow a layer
of white wax, like an incipient fall of snow, lay invitingly
on the bare white pine boarding. And, too, it
seemed only natural that the moment she came into
the room ready for the fray, Daisy Furrer should
make a rush for the ancient piano, and tinkle out
with fair execution the strains of an old waltz. Her
efforts broke up any sign of constraint; everybody
knew everybody else, so they danced. This was the
beginning; cards would come later.</p>
<p>They could all dance, and right well, too. Faces
devoid of the absorbing properties of powder quickly
shone with the exercise; complexions innocent of all
trace of pigments and the toilet arts glowed with a
healthy hue and beamed with perfect happiness.
There could be no doubt that Prudence and her
mother knew their world as well as any hostess could
wish. And it was all so easy; no formality, few
punctilios to observe&ndash;&ndash;just free-and-easy good-fellowship.</p>
<p>Mrs. Malling emerged from the region of the
kitchen. She was a little heated with her exertions,
and a stray wisp or two of grey hair escaping from
beneath her quaint lace cap testified to her culinary
exertions. She had been stooping at her ovens
regardless of her appearance. She found her daughter
standing beside the door of the parlour engaged in a
desultory conversation with Peter Furrer. Prudence
hailed her mother with an air of relief, and the
monumental Peter moved heavily away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, mother dear, it&#8217;s too bad of you,&#8221; exclaimed
the girl, gazing at her critically. &#8220;And after all the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
trouble I took with your cap! Look at it now. It&#8217;s
all on one side, and your hair is sticking out like&ndash;&ndash;like&ndash;&ndash;Timothy
grass. Stand still while I fix it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s deft fingers soon arranged her mother
afresh, the old lady protesting all the while, but
submitting patiently to the operation.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there; you children think of nothing but
pushing and patting and tittivating. La, but one &#8217;ud
think I was going to sit down at table with a King or
a Minister of the Church. Nobody&#8217;s going to look at
me, child&ndash;&ndash;until the victuals come on. Besides, what
does it matter with neighbours? Look at old Gleichen
over there, bowing and scraping to Mrs. Ganthorn;
one would think it wasn&#8217;t his way to do nothing else.
He&#8217;s less elaborate when he&#8217;s trailing after his plough.
My, but I can&#8217;t abide such pretending. Guess some
folks think women are blind. And where&#8217;s George
Iredale? I don&#8217;t see him. Now there&#8217;d be some
excuse for his doing the grand. He&#8217;s a gentleman
born and bred.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, mother, we all know your weakness for
Mr. Iredale,&#8221; replied Prudence, with an affectionate
finishing pat to the grey old head. &#8220;But then he
just wouldn&#8217;t &#8216;bow and scrape,&#8217; as you call it, to
Mrs. Ganthorn or anybody else. He&#8217;s not the sort
for that kind of thing. He hasn&#8217;t come yet. I&#8217;ll
bring him to you at once, dear, when he arrives,&#8221;
she finished up with a laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a saucy hussy,&#8221; her mother returned, with
a chuckle. Then: &#8220;But I&#8217;d have taken to him as
a son. Girls never learn anything now-a-days until
they&#8217;re married to the man they fancy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing like personal experience, lady mother.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
Did you ask any one&#8217;s advice when you married
father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That I didn&#8217;t for sure, child, but it was different.
Your father, Silas, wasn&#8217;t the man to be put off with
any notions. He just said he was going to marry
me&ndash;&ndash;and he did marry me. I was all sort of swept
off my feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But still you chose him yourself,&#8221; persisted the
girl, laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, maybe I did, child, maybe I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And <i>you</i> didn&#8217;t regret your own choice, mother;
so why should I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, it was different with me&ndash;&ndash;quite different.
Ah, there&#8217;s some one coming in.&#8221; Hephzibah Malling
turned as she spoke, glad to be able to change the
subject. The front door was opened, and a fur-clad
figure entered. &#8220;It&#8217;s George Iredale,&#8221; she went on,
as the man removed his cap and displayed a crown
of dark-brown hair, tinged here and there with grey,
a broad high forehead and a pair of serious eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along, George.&#8221; Mrs. Malling bustled forward,
followed by her daughter. &#8220;I thought you
couldn&#8217;t get, maybe. The folks are all dancing and
dallying. You must come into the kitchen first and
have something warm. It&#8217;s a cold night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I meant to come earlier,&#8221; replied the new arrival,
in a deep, quiet voice. &#8220;Unfortunately, just as I
was going to start, word was brought in to me that
a suspicious-looking horseman was hovering round.
You see my place is so isolated that any arrival has
to be inquired into. There are so many horse-thieves
and other dangerous characters about that I have to
be careful. Well, I rode out to ascertain who the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
intruder was, but I lost him. That delayed me.
How are you, and Prudence too? Why, it&#8217;s ages
since I&#8217;ve seen either of you. Yes, something hot is
always welcome after a long winter&#8217;s ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>George Iredale had divested himself of his coat
and over-shoes, and now followed his hostess to
the kitchen. He was a man of considerable inches,
being little short of six feet in height. He was
powerfully built, although his clothes disguised the
fact to a large extent, and his height made him look
even slim. He had a strong, keen, plain face that
was very large-featured, and would undoubtedly have
been downright ugly but for an expression of kindly
patience, not unmixed with a suspicion of amused
tolerance. It was the face of a man in whom women
like to place confidence, and with whom men never
attempt to take liberties. He had, too, a charm of
manner unusual in men living the rough life of the
prairie.</p>
<p>The tinkling strains of the waltz had ceased, and
Prudence went back to the parlour. She felt that
it was high time to set the tables for &#8220;progressive
euchre.&#8221; It was past eight and Grey had not turned
up. She began to think he intended carrying out
his threat of staying away. Well, if he chose to do
so he could. She wouldn&#8217;t ask him to do otherwise.
She felt unhappy about him in spite of her brave
thoughts.</p>
<p>Her announcement of cards was hailed with delight,
and the guests departed with a rush to search
the house for a sufficient number of small tables to
cope with the requirements of the game.</p>
<p>In the kitchen George Iredale was slowly sipping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
a steaming glass of rye whisky toddy. He was
seated in a rigid, high-backed arm-chair, well away
from the huge cook-stove, at which Hephzibah
Malling was presiding. Many kettles and saucepans
stood steaming upon the black iron top, and the
occasional opening and shutting of the ovens told of
dainties which needed the old farm-wife&#8217;s most
watchful care. Mrs. Malling&#8217;s occupation, however,
did not interrupt her flow of conversation. George
Iredale was a great favourite of hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s like his poor father in some things,&#8221; she
was saying, as she lifted a batch of small biscuits
out of the oven and moved towards the ice-box with
them. &#8220;He never squealed about his misfortune to
me. Not one letter did I get asking for help. He&#8217;s
proud, is Hervey. And now I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused with her hand on the open door of the
refrigerator and looked back into the man&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he tell you any details of his failure? What
was responsible for it?&#8221; Iredale asked, poising his
glass on one of the unyielding arms of his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that he didn&#8217;t, not even that,&#8221; in a tone of
pride. &#8220;He just said he&#8217;d failed. That he was
&#8216;broke.&#8217; He&#8217;s too knocked up with travelling&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s
come from Winnipeg right here&ndash;&ndash;or you should hear
it from his own lips. He never blamed no one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&ndash;&ndash;and you are going to help him, Mrs.
Malling. What are you going to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where I&#8217;m fixed some. Money he can
have&ndash;&ndash;all he wants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale shook his head gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bad policy, Mrs. Malling&ndash;&ndash;until you know all the
facts.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What, my own flesh and blood, too? Well,
there&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean nothing derogatory to your boy, believe
me,&#8221; interrupted Iredale, as he noted the heightened
colour of face and the angry sparkle that flashed
in the good dame&#8217;s eyes &#8220;I simply mean that it
is useless to throw good money after bad. Fruit
farming is a lottery in which the prizes go to those
who take the most tickets. In other words, it is a
question of acreage. A small man may lose his
crop through blight, drought, a hundred causes.
The larger man has a better chance by reason of
the extent of his crop. Now I should take it, you
could do better for your son by obtaining all the
facts, sorting them out and then deciding what to
do. My experience prompts me to suggest another
business. Why not the farm?&#8221;</p>
<p>All signs of resentment had left Mrs. Malling&#8217;s
face. She deposited her biscuits and returned to the
stove, standing before her guest with her hands
buried deep in her apron pockets and a delighted
smile on her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I thought at once,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;You&#8217;re real smart, George; why not the farm? I says
that to myself right off. I couldn&#8217;t do better, I know,
but there&#8217;s drawbacks. Yes, drawbacks. Hervey isn&#8217;t
much for the petticoats&ndash;&ndash;meaning his own folks. He&#8217;s
not one to play second fiddle, so to speak. Now while
I live the farm is mine, and I learned my business
from one who could teach me&ndash;&ndash;my Silas. Now I&#8217;d
make Hervey my foreman and give him a good wage.
He&#8217;d have all he wants, but he&#8217;d have to be <i>my</i> foreman.&#8221;
The old lady shook her head dubiously.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And you think Hervey wouldn&#8217;t accept a subordinate
position?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s that proud. Just like my poor Silas,&#8221;
murmured the mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he&#8217;s a fool. But you try him,&#8221; Iredale said
dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think he might?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You never can tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder now if you&ndash;&ndash;yes, I&#8217;ll ask him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Offer it to him, you mean.&#8221; George Iredale
smiled quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, offer it to him,&#8221; the old lady corrected herself
thoughtfully. &#8220;But I&#8217;m forgetting my stewing
oysters, and Mistress Prudence will get going on&ndash;&ndash;for
she had them sent up all the way from St. John&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;if
they&#8217;re burned.&#8221; She turned to one of the kettles
and began stirring at once. &#8220;Hervey is coming back
after he&#8217;s been to Niagara, and I&#8217;ll talk to him then.
I wish you could have seen him before he went, but
he&#8217;s abed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, there&#8217;s time enough when he comes
back. Ah, Prudence, how is the euchre &#8216;progressing&#8217;?&#8221;
Iredale turned as the girl came hurriedly in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, here you are. You two gossiping as usual.
Mother, it&#8217;s too bad of you to rob me of my guests.
But I came to ask for more lemonade.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dip it out of yonder kettle, child. And you can
take George off at once. It&#8217;s high time he got at the
cards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s too late, the game is nearly over. He&#8217;ll
have to sit out with Leslie. He, also, was too late.
Come along, Mr. Iredale,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;she had filled the lemonade
pitcher,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;and, mother, when shall you be ready
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
with the supper? Remember, you&#8217;ve got to come
and give out the prizes to the winners before that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Also to the losers,&#8221; put in Iredale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they must all have prizes. What time,
mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In an hour. And be off, the pair of you. Mary!
Mary!&#8221; the old lady called out, moving towards the
summer kitchen. &#8220;Bustle about, girl, and count down
the plates from the dresser. La, look at you,&#8221; she
went on, as the hired girl came running in; &#8220;where&#8217;s the
cap I gave you? And for good-a-mussey&#8217;s sake go
and scrub your hands. My, but girls be jades.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale and Prudence went off to the parlour. The
game was nearly over, and the guests were laughing
and chattering noisily. The excitement was intense.
Leslie Grey sat aloof. He was engaged in a pretence
at conversation with Sarah Gurridge, but, to judge
by the expression of his face, his temper was still
sulky or his thoughts were far away. The moment
Iredale entered the room Grey&#8217;s face lit up with
something like interest.</p>
<p>Prudence, accompanying the rancher, was quick to
observe the change. She had been prepared for
something of the sort, although the reason she assigned
to his interest was very wide of the mark. She smiled
to herself as she turned to reply to something Iredale
had just said.</p>
<p>The evening passed in boisterous jollification. And
after the prizes had been awarded supper was served.
A solid supper, just such a repast as these people
could and did appreciate. The delicacies Mrs.
Malling offered to her guests were something to be
remembered. She spared no pains, and even her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
enemies, if she had any, which is doubtful, admitted
that she could cook; such an admission amongst
the prairie folks was a testimonial of the highest
order.</p>
<p>After supper George Iredale, whose quiet manner
and serious face debarred him from the revels of the
younger men, withdrew to a small work-room which
was usually set aside on these occasions for the use of
those who desired to smoke. Leslie Grey, who had
been talking to Mrs. Malling, and who had been
watching for this opportunity, quickly followed.</p>
<p>He fondly believed that Iredale came to the farm
to thrust his attentions upon Prudence. This was
exasperating enough in itself, but when Grey, in his
righteous indignation, thought of other matters
pertaining to the owner of Lonely Ranch, his indignation
rose to boiling pitch. He meant to have it
out with him to-night.</p>
<p>Iredale had already adjusted himself into a comfortable
chintz-covered arm-chair when Grey arrived upon
the scene. A great briar pipe hung from the corner
of his strong, decided mouth, and he was smoking
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Grey moved briskly to another chair and flung
himself into its depths with little regard for its age.
Nor did he attempt to smoke. His mind was too
active and disturbed for anything so calm and
soothing.</p>
<p>His first words indicated the condition of his
mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kicking up a racket in there,&#8221; he said jerkily,
indicating the parlour. &#8220;Can&#8217;t stand such a noise
when I&#8217;ve got a lot to think about.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Iredale nodded his head and spoke without
removing the pipe from his mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are to be married to-morrow week&ndash;&ndash;Prudence
and I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;ve been told. I congratulate you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale looked at his companion with grave eyes.
They were quite alone in the room. He had met
Grey frequently and had learned to understand his
ways and to know his bull-headed methods. Now he
quietly waited. He had a shrewd suspicion that the
man had something unpleasant to say. Unconsciously
his teeth closed tighter upon his pipe.</p>
<p>Grey raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks. I hardly expected it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why not?&#8221; Iredale was smiling, his grey
eyes had a curious look in them&ndash;&ndash;something between
quizzical amusement and surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; the other retorted with a
shrug. &#8220;There is no telling how some men will take
these things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale removed his pipe, and pressed the ash
down with his little finger. The operation required the
momentary lowering of his eyes from his companion&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I understand you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grey laughed unpleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not much need of comprehension. If two
men run after the same girl and one succeeds where
the other fails, the successful suitor doesn&#8217;t usually
expect congratulations from his unfortunate rival.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Supposing such to be the case in point,&#8221; Iredale
replied quietly, but with an ominous lowering of his
eyelids. &#8220;Mark you, I only say &#8216;supposing.&#8217; I admit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
nothing&ndash;&ndash;to you. The less successful man may surely
be honest enough, and man enough, to wish his rival
well. I have known such cases among&ndash;&ndash;men.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grey twisted himself round in his chair and assumed
a truculent attitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Notwithstanding the fact that the rival in question
never loses an opportunity of seeking out the particular
girl, and continuing his attentions after she is engaged
to the other? That may be the way among&ndash;&ndash;men.
But not honest men.&#8221;</p>
<p>The expression of Iredale&#8217;s face remained quite
calm. Only his eyes&ndash;&ndash;keen, direct-gazing eyes&ndash;&ndash;lit
up with an angry sparkle. He drew a little more
rapidly at his pipe, perhaps, but he spoke quietly still.
He quite understood that Grey intended forcing a
quarrel upon him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not pretend to misunderstand you, Grey.
Your manner puts that out of the question. You are
unwarrantably accusing me of a most ungentlemanly
proceeding. Such an accusation being made by any
one&ndash;&ndash;what shall I say?&ndash;&ndash;more responsible than you,
I should take considerable notice of; as it is, it is
hardly worth my consideration. You are at best a
blunderer. I should pause before I replied had I the
misfortune to be you, and try to recollect where you
are. If you wish to quarrel there is time and place
for so doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale&#8217;s words stung Leslie Grey to the quick. His
irresponsible temper fairly jumped within him, his
eyes danced with rage, and he could scarcely find
words to express himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may sneer as much as you like,&#8221; he at length
blurted out, &#8220;but you cannot deny that your visits to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
this house are paid with the object of addressing my
affianced wife. You are right when you describe such
conduct as ungentlemanly. You are no gentleman!
But I do not suppose that the man who owns Lonely
Ranch will feel the sting of being considered a&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;cad
or anything else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; Iredale was roused, and there was no
mistaking the set of his square jaw and the compression
between his brows. &#8220;You have gone a step too
far. You shall apologize or&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop&ndash;&ndash;eh? You may well demand that I should&ndash;&ndash;stop,
Mr. George Iredale. Were I to go on you
would have a distinctly bad time of it. But my
present consideration is not with the concerns of
Lonely Ranch, but only with your visits here, which
shall cease from to-day out. And as for apologizing
for anything I have said, I&#8217;ll see you damned
first.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a pause; a breathless pause. The two
men confronted each other, both held calm by a
strength which a moment ago would have seemed
impossible in at least one of them.</p>
<p>Grey&#8217;s face worked painfully with suppressed
excitement, but he gripped himself. George Iredale
was calm under the effort of swift thought. He was
the first to break the silence, and he did so in a voice
well modulated and under perfect control. But the
mouthpiece of his pipe was nearly bitten through.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I shall be glad if you will go on. You
apparently have further charges to make against me.
I hardly know whether I am in the presence of a
madman or a fool. One or the other, I am sure.
You may as well make your charges at once. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
will certainly answer for all you have already said, so
make the list of your accusations complete before&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You fool!&#8221; hissed Grey, goaded to the last
extremity of patience. His headlong nature could
not long endure restraint. Now his words came with
a blind rush.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think I&#8217;d speak without being sure of
my ground? Do you think, because other men who
have occupied the position which is mine at Ainsley
have been blind, that I am? Lonely Ranch; a fitting
title for your place,&#8221; with a sneer. &#8220;Lonely! in
neighbourhood, yes, but not as regards its owner.
You are wealthy, probably the wealthiest man in
the province of Manitoba; why, that alone should
have been sufficient to set the hounds of the law on
your trail. I know the secret of Lonely Ranch. I
have watched day after day the notice you have
inserted in the <i>Free Press</i>&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;Yellow booming&ndash;&ndash;slump
in Grey.&#8217; Nor have I rested until I discovered your
secret. I shall make no charge here beyond what I
have said, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He suddenly broke off, awakening from his blind
rage to the fact of what he was doing. His mouth
shut like a trap, and beads of perspiration broke out
upon his forehead. His eyes lowered before the
ironical gaze of his companion. Thus he sat for a
moment a prey to futile regrets. His anger had
undone him. The sound of a short laugh fell upon
his ears, and, as though drawn by a magnet, his eyes
were once more turned on the face of the rancher.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was not sure which it was,&#8221; said Iredale dryly;
&#8220;whether you were a fool or a madman. Now
I know. I had hoped that it was madness. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
is hope for a madman, but none for a fool. Thank
you, Grey, for the information you have supplied
me with. Your folly has defeated your ends. Remember
this. You will never be able to use the
&#8216;Secret&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;as you are pleased to call it&ndash;&ndash;of Lonely
Ranch. I will take good care of that. And now, as
I hear sounds of people running up-stairs, we will
postpone further discussion. This interview has been
prolonged sufficiently&ndash;&ndash;more than sufficiently for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale rose from his chair; to all appearance he
was quite undisturbed. Grey&#8217;s condition was exactly
the reverse.</p>
<p>He, too, rose from his seat. There was a sound of
some one approaching the door. Grey stepped up to
his companion and put his mouth close to his ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget that you cannot conceal the traces
that are round your&ndash;&ndash;ranch. Traces which are unmistakable
to those who have an inkling of the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I can take steps which will effectually
nullify the exertions you have been put to. Remember
you said I was wealthy. I am tired of your stupid
long-winded talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale turned away with a movement of disgust
and irritation just as the door opened and Prudence
came in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, here you are, you two. I have been wondering
where you were all this time. Do you know the
people are going home?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl ceased speaking abruptly and looked
keenly at the two men before her. Iredale was
smiling; Grey was gazing down at the stove, and
apparently not listening to her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></div>
<p>Prudence saw that something was wrong, but she
had no suspicion of the truth. She wondered; then
she delivered a message she had brought and dismissed
Iredale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother wants to see you, Mr. Iredale; something
about Hervey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go to her at once.&#8221; And the owner of
Lonely Ranch passed out of the room.</p>
<p>The moment the door closed behind him the girl
turned anxiously to her lover.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Leslie dear? You are not angry with
me still?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man laughed mirthlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Angry? No, child. I wonder if I&ndash;&ndash;no, better
not. It&#8217;s time to be off. Give me a kiss, and I&#8217;ll say
good-night.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>LESLIE GREY FULFILS HIS DESTINY</h3>
</div>
<p>It was early morning. Early even for the staff of
the Rodney House Hotel. And Leslie Grey was
about to breakfast. The solitary waitress the hotel
boasted was laying the tables for the eight-o&#8217;clock
meal. The room had not yet assumed the spick-and-span
appearance which it would wear later
on. There was a suggestion of last night&#8217;s supper
about the atmosphere; and the girl, too, who moved
swiftly here and there arranging the tables, was still
clad in her early morning, frowsy print dress, and her
hair showed signs of having been hastily adjusted
without the aid of a looking-glass. A sight of her
suggested an abrupt rising at the latest possible
moment.</p>
<p>From the kitchen beyond a savoury odour of steak
and coffee penetrated the green baize swing-door
which stood at one end of the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that steak nearly ready?&#8221; asked Grey irritably,
as the girl flicked some crumbs from the opposite end
of his table on to the floor, with that deft flourish of a
dirty napkin which waitresses usually obtain.</p>
<p>She paused in her work, and her hand went up
consciously to the screws of paper which adorned her
front hair.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yessir, it&#8217;ll be along right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she continued to flick the table in other
directions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ordered breakfast for six o&#8217;clock. This is the
slackest place I ever knew. I shall talk to Morton
and see if things can&#8217;t be altered. Just go and rouse
that cook up. I&#8217;ve got to make Leonville before
two.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl gave a final angry flick at an imaginary
crumb and flounced off in the direction of the kitchen.
The next moment her shrill voice was heard addressing
the cook.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Grey wants his breakfast&ndash;&ndash;sharp, Molly.
Dish it up. If it ain&#8217;t done it&#8217;s his look-out. There&#8217;s
no pleasing some folks. I s&#8217;pose Mr. Chillingwood&#8217;ll
be along d&#8217;rectly. Better put something on for him
or there&#8217;ll be a row. What&#8217;s that&ndash;&ndash;steak? That
ain&#8217;t no good for Mr. Robb. He wants pork chops.
He never eats anything else for breakfast. Says he&#8217;s
used to pork.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl returned to the breakfast room bearing
Grey&#8217;s steak and some potatoes. Coffee followed
quickly, and the officer attacked his victuals hungrily.
Then Robb Chillingwood appeared.</p>
<p>Leslie Grey was about to rate the girl for her
remarks to the cook, but Robb interrupted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how does the bridegroom feel?&#8221; he asked
cheerily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? Cranky on your wedding
morning?&#8221; pursued the town clerk irrepressibly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to goodness you&#8217;d keep your mouth shut.
Why don&#8217;t you go and proclaim my affairs from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
steps of your beastly Town Hall?&#8221; Grey glanced
meaningly in the direction of the waitress standing in
open-mouthed astonishment beside one of the tables.</p>
<p>Robb laughed and his eyes twinkled mischievously.
He turned sharply on the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, didn&#8217;t you know that Mr. Grey was going
to be married to-day?&#8221; he asked, with assumed
solemnity. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m blessed,&#8221; as the girl shook her
head and giggled. &#8220;You neglect your duty, Nellie,
my girl. What are you here for but to &#8216;sling hash&#8217;
and learn all the gossip and scandal concerning the
boarders? Yes, Mr. Grey is going to get married
to-day, and I&ndash;&ndash;I am to be his best man. Now be off,
and fetch my &#8216;mutton&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;which is pork.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl ran off to do as she was bid, and also to
convey the news to her friends in the kitchen. Robb
sat down beside his companion and chuckled softly
as he gazed at Grey&#8217;s ill-humoured face, and listened
to the shrieks of laughter which were borne on the
atmosphere of cooking from beyond the baize door.</p>
<p>Grey choked down his indignation. For once he
understood that protest would not serve him. Everything
about his marriage had been kept quiet in
Ainsley up till now, not because there was any need
for it, but Robb had acceded to his expressed wishes.
The latter, however, felt himself in no way bound to
keep silence on this, the eventful day. Robb attacked
some toast as a preliminary, while the other devoured
his steak. Then Grey looked up from his plate.
His face had cleared; his ill-humour had been
replaced by a look of keen earnestness.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a beastly nuisance that this is my wedding
day,&#8221; he began. &#8220;Yes, I mean it,&#8221; as Robb looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
up in horrified astonishment. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mean anything
derogatory to anybody. I just state an obvious fact.
You would understand if you knew all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, damn it, man, you ought to be ashamed of
yourself for saying such a thing. You are marrying
one of the best and sweetest girls in Southern Manitoba,
and yet&ndash;&ndash;why, it&#8217;s enough to choke a man off
his feed.&#8221; Chillingwood was angry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a fool. You haven&#8217;t many brains, I
know, but use the few you possess now, and listen to
me. A week ago, yes; a week hence, yes. But for
the next three days I have some dangerous work on
hand that must be done. Work of my department.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, dirty work, I suppose, or there&#8217;d be no &#8216;must&#8217;
or &#8216;danger&#8217; about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grey shrugged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Call it what you like. Since you&#8217;ve left the service
I notice you look at things differently,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Anyway, it&#8217;s good enough for me to be determined
to see it through in spite of my wedding. Damn it,
there&#8217;s always some obstacle or other cropping up
at inopportune moments in my life. However&ndash;&ndash;I
wish I knew whether I could still trust you to do
something for me. It would simplify matters considerably.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robb looked serious. He might not be possessed
of many brains, as Grey had suggested&ndash;&ndash;although
Grey&#8217;s opinions were generally warped&ndash;&ndash;but he
thought well before he replied. And when he spoke
he showed considerable decision and foresight.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can trust me all right enough if the matter is
clean and honest. I&#8217;ll do nothing dirty for you or
anybody else. I&#8217;ve seen too much.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s clean enough. I don&#8217;t dirty my hands
with dishonest dealings. I simply do my duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But your sense of duty is an exaggerated one&ndash;&ndash;peculiar.
I notice that it takes the form of any
practices which you consider will advance your
personal interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It so happens that my &#8216;personal interests&#8217; are
synonymous with the interests of those I serve. But
all I require is the delivery of a letter in Winnipeg,
at a certain time on a given date. I can&#8217;t trust the
post for a very particular reason, and as for the telegraph,
that wouldn&#8217;t answer my purpose. I could
employ a messenger, but that would not do either&ndash;&ndash;a
disinterested messenger could be got at. You, I
know, couldn&#8217;t be&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;influenced. If you fail me,
then I must do it myself, which means that I must
leave my bride shortly after the ceremony to-day, and
not return to her until Friday, more than two days
hence. That&#8217;s how the matter stands. I will pay all
your expenses and give you a substantial present to
boot. Just for delivering a letter to the chief of police
in Winnipeg. I will go and write it at once if you
consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robb shook his head doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must know more than that. First, I must know,
in confidence of course, the object of that letter.
And, secondly, who is to be the victim of your machinations.
Without these particulars you can count me
&#8216;out.&#8217; I&#8217;ll be no party to anything I might afterwards
have cause to regret.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That settles it then,&#8221; replied Grey resentfully. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t reveal the name of my &#8216;victim,&#8217; as you so
graphically put it. You happen to know him, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
believe, and are on a friendly footing with him.&#8221; He
finished up with a callous laugh.</p>
<p>Robb&#8217;s eyes shone wickedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove, Grey, you&#8217;ve sunk pretty low in your
efforts to regain your lost position. I always knew
that you hadn&#8217;t a particle of feeling in your whole
body for any one but yourself, but I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d
treat me to a taste of your rotten ways. Were it not
for the sake of Alice Gordon&#8217;s chum, the girl you are
going to marry, I wouldn&#8217;t be your best man. You
have become utterly impossible, and, after to-day&#8217;s
event, I wash my hands of you. Damn it, you&#8217;re a
skunk!&#8221;</p>
<p>Grey laughed loudly, but there was no mirth in his
hilarity. It was a heartless, nervous laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy, Robb, don&#8217;t get on your high horse,&#8221; he said
presently. Then he became silent, and a sigh escaped
him. &#8220;I had to make the suggestion,&#8221; he went on,
after a while. &#8220;You are the only man I dared to
trust. Confound it, if you must have it, I&#8217;m sorry!&#8221;
The apology came out with a jerk; it seemed to have
been literally wrung from him. &#8220;Try and forget it,
Robb,&#8221; he went on, more quietly, &#8220;we&#8217;ve known each
other for so many years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robb was slightly mollified, but he was not likely
to forget his companion&#8217;s proposition. He changed
the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talking of Winnipeg, you know I was up there
on business the other day. I had a bit of a shock
while I was walking about the dep&ocirc;t waiting for the
train to start.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh.&#8221; Grey was not paying much attention; he
was absorbed in his own thoughts.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Robb went on. &#8220;You remember Mr.
Zachary Smith?&#8221;</p>
<p>His companion looked up with a violent start.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess. What of him? I&#8217;m not likely to
forget him easily. There is just one desire I have in
life which dwarfs all others to insignificance, and that
is to stand face to face with Mr. Zachary Smith,&#8221;
Grey finished up significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! So I should suppose,&#8221; Robb went on.
&#8220;Those are my feelings to a nicety. But I didn&#8217;t
quite realize my desire, and, besides, I wasn&#8217;t sure,
anyhow. A man appeared, just for one moment, at
the booking-office door as I happened to pass it. He
stared at me, and I caught his eye. Then he beat a
retreat before I had called his face to mind&ndash;&ndash;you see,
his appearance was quite changed. A moment later
I remembered him, or thought I did, and gave chase.
But I had lost him, couldn&#8217;t discover a trace of him,
and nearly lost the train into the bargain. Mind, I
am not positive of the fellow&#8217;s identity, but I&#8217;d gamble
a few dollars on the matter, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord! I&#8217;d have missed fifty trains rather than have
lost sight of him. Just our luck,&#8221; Grey exclaimed
violently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if he&#8217;s in the district, we&#8217;ll come across him
again. Perhaps you will have the next chance.&#8221; Robb
pushed his chair back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was he, right enough,&#8221; Robb went on meditatively,
his cheery face puckered into an expression of
perplexity. &#8220;He was well dressed, too, in the garb
of an ordinary citizen, and looked quite clean and
respectable. His face had filled out; but it was his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
eyes that fixed me. You remember those two great,
deep-sunken, cow-eyes of his&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Robb broke off as
he saw Grey start. &#8220;Why, what&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>
<p>Grey shook himself; then he gazed straight before
him. Nor did he heed his companion&#8217;s question. A
strongly-marked pucker appeared between his eyebrows,
and a look of uncertainty was upon his face.
Robb again urged him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t seen him?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Grey.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have just remembered something. I came across
a&ndash;&ndash;stranger the other day. He was wrapped in furs,
and I could only see his eyes. But those eyes were distinctly
familiar&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;cow&#8217;-eyes, I think you said. I was
struck with their appearance at the time, but couldn&#8217;t
just realize where I had seen eyes like &#8217;em before.&#8221;
Then he went on reflectively: &#8220;But no, it couldn&#8217;t
have been he. Ah&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He broke off and glanced
in the direction of the window as the jangle of sleigh-bells
sounded outside. &#8220;Here&#8217;s our cutter. Come
on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robb rose from his seat and brushed the crumbs
from his trousers. There came the sound of voices
from the other side of the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the boys,&#8221; said Robb, with a meaning
smile. &#8220;It&#8217;s early for &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe this is your doing,&#8221; said Grey sulkily.</p>
<p>Robb nodded in the direction of the window.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a team. This is no &#8216;one-horsed&#8217;
affair.&#8221;</p>
<p>The door opened suddenly and two men entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, here he is,&#8221; said one, Charlie Trellis, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
postmaster, with a laugh. &#8220;Congratulate you, Grey,
my friend. Double harness, eh? Tame you down,
my boy. Good thing, marriage&ndash;&ndash;for taming a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not looking your best,&#8221; said the other,
Jack Broad, the telegraph operator. &#8220;Why, man, you
look as though you were going to your own funeral.
Buck up! Come and have a &#8216;Collins&#8217;; brace you
up for the ordeal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to the devil, both of you,&#8221; said Grey ungraciously.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t swill eye-openers all day like you,
Jack Broad. Got something else to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it seems. But cheer up, man,&#8221; replied Broad
imperturbably, &#8220;it&#8217;s not as bad as having a tooth
drawn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor half as unpleasant as a funeral,&#8221; put in
Trellis, with a grin.</p>
<p>Grey turned to Robb.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he said abruptly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get. I shall
say things in a minute if I stay here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That &#8217;ud be something new for you,&#8221; called out
Broad, as the two men left the room.</p>
<p>The door closed on his remark and he turned to
his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for the poor girl,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;The
most can-tankerous pig I ever ran up against&ndash;&ndash;is
Grey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed the other; &#8220;I can&#8217;t think how a
decent fellow like Robb Chillingwood can chum up
with him. He&#8217;s a surly clown&ndash;&ndash;only fit for such
countries as the Yukon, where he comes from. He&#8217;s
not particularly clever either. Yes,&#8221; turning to the
waitress, &#8220;the usual. How would you like to be the
bride?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></div>
<p>The girl shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thanks. I like candy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, not vinegar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor&ndash;&ndash;nor&ndash;&ndash;pigs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Broad turned to the grey-headed postmaster with a
loud guffaw.</p>
<p>&#8220;She seems to have sized Grey up pretty slick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside in the hall the two men donned their furs
and over-shoes. Fortunately for Grey&#8217;s peace of
mind there was no one else about. The bar-tender
was sweeping the office out, but he did not pause in
his work. Outside the front door the livery-stable
man was holding the horses. Grey took his seat to
drive, and wrapped the robes well about him. It was
a bitterly cold morning. Robb was just about to climb
in beside him when a ginger-headed man clad in a
pea-jacket came running from the direction of the
Town Hall. He waved one arm vigorously, clutching
in his hand a piece of paper. Robb saw him first.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something for me, as sure as a gun. Hold on,
Grey,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s Sutton, the sheriff. I wonder
what&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>
<p>The ginger-headed man came up breathlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought I was going to miss you, Chillingwood.
A message from the Mayor. &#8216;Doc&#8217; Ridley sends
word that the United States marshal has got that
horse-thief, Le Mar, over the other side. You&#8217;ll have
to make out the papers for bringing him over. I&#8217;ve
got to go and fetch him at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, hang it, man, I can&#8217;t do them now,&#8221; exclaimed
Robb.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s on leave of absence,&#8221; put in Grey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t be helped. I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; said the sheriff.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s business, you know. Besides, it won&#8217;t take
you more than an hour. I must get across to Verdon
before noon or it&#8217;ll be too late to get the papers
&#8216;backed&#8217; there. Come on, man; you can get another
cutter and follow Grey up in an hour. You won&#8217;t
lose much time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and who&#8217;s going to pay the damage?&#8221; said
Robb, relinquishing his hold on the cutter&#8217;s rail.</p>
<p>The sheriff shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to stay,&#8221; he said conclusively.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so. Grey, I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; replied Grey coldly. &#8220;It&#8217;s
not your fault. Well, good-bye. Don&#8217;t bother to
follow me up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn!&#8221; ejaculated the good-hearted Robb, as
the cutter moved away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to get married, ain&#8217;t he?&#8221; said the sheriff
shortly, as Grey departed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; And the two men walked off in the direction
of Chillingwood&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>And Grey drove off to his wedding alone. He
was denied even the support of the only man who,
out of sheer good-heartedness, would have accompanied
him. The life of a man is more surely influenced
by the peculiarities of his own disposition than
anything else. When a man takes to himself a wife,
it is naturally a time for the well-wishes of his friends.
This man set out alone. Not one God-speed went
with him. And yet he was not disturbed by the lack
of sympathy. He looked at life from an uncommon
standpoint, measuring its scope for the attainment of
happiness by his own capacity for doing, not by any
association with his kind. He was one of those men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
who need no friendship from his fellows, preferring
rather to be without it. Thus he considered he was
freer to follow his own methods of life. Position
was his goal&ndash;&ndash;position in the walk of life he had
chosen. Could he not attain this solely by his own
exertions, then he would do without it.</p>
<p>The crisp, morning air smote his cheeks with the
sting of a whip-lash as he drove down the bush-lined
trail which led from the Rodney House to the railway
dep&ocirc;t. It was necessary for him to cross the track at
this point before he would find himself upon the
prairie road to the Leonville school-house, at which
place the ceremony was to be performed. The &#8220;gush&#8221;
of the horses&#8217; nostrils sounded refreshingly in his ears
as the animals fairly danced over the smooth, icy trail.
The sleigh-bells jangled with a confused clashing of
sounds in response to the gait of the eager beasts.
But Grey thought little of these things. He thought
little of anything just now but his intended despoiling
of the owner of Lonely Ranch. All other matters
were quite subsidiary to his one chief object.</p>
<p>Once out in the open, the horses settled down into
their long-distance stride. Here the trail was not so
good as in the precincts of the village. The snow
was deeper and softer. Now and then the horses&#8217;
hoofs would break through the frozen crust and sink
well above the fetlocks into the under-snow.</p>
<p>Now the thick bush, which surrounded the village,
gave place to a sparser covering of scattered bluffs,
and the grey-white aspect of the country became
apparent. The trail was well marked as far as the
eye could reach&ndash;&ndash;two great furrows ploughed by the
passage of horses and the runners of the farmers&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
heavy &#8220;double-bobs.&#8221; Besides this, the colour was
different. There was a strong suggestion of earthiness
about the trail which was not to be observed
upon the rolling snow-fields of the surrounding
prairie.</p>
<p>The air was still though keen, and the morning sun
had already risen well above the mist of grey clouds
which still hovered above the eastern horizon. There
was a striking solemnity over all. It was the morning
promise of a fair day, and soon the dazzling sunshine
upon the snow would become blinding to eyes
unused to the winter prairie.</p>
<p>But Grey was no tenderfoot. Such things had no
terrors for him. His half-closed eyes faced the glare
of light defiantly. It is only the inexperienced who
gaze across the snow-bound earth, at such a time,
with wide-open eyes.</p>
<p>The bluffs became scarcer as mile after mile was
covered by the long, raking strides of the hardy
horses. Occasionally Grey was forced to pull off the
trail into the deep snow to allow the heavy-laden
hay-rack of some farmer to pass, or a box-sleigh,
weighted down with sacks of grain, toiling on its way
to the Ainsley elevator. These inconveniences were
the rule of the road, the lighter always giving way
to the heavier conveyance.</p>
<p>Ten miles from Ainsley and the wide open sea of
snow proclaimed the prairie in its due form. Not a
tree in sight, not a rock, not a hill to break the awful
monotony. Just one vast rolling expanse of snow
gleaming beneath the dazzling rays of a now warming
sun. A hungry coyote and his mate prowling in
search of food at a distance of half-a-mile looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
large by reason of their isolation. An occasional
covey of prairie chicken, noisily winging their way to
a far-distant bluff, might well be startling both to
horses and driver. A dark ribbon-like flight of ducks
or geese, high up in the heavens, speeding from the
south to be early in the field when the sodden prairie
should be open, was something to distract the attention
of even the most pre-occupied. But Grey was
oblivious to everything except the trail beneath him,
the gait of his team, and his scheme for advancement.
The sun mounted higher, and the time passed
rapidly to the traveller. And, as the record of mileage
rose, the face of the snow-clad earth began again to
change its appearance. The undulations of the
prairie assumed vaster proportions. The waves rose
to the size of hills, and the gentle hollows sank
deeper until they declined into gaping valleys.
Here and there trees and small clumps of leafless
bush dotted the view. A house or two, with barn
looming largely in the rear, and spidery fencing,
stretching in rectangular directions, suggested homesteads;
the barking of dogs&ndash;&ndash;life. These signs of
habitation continued, and became now more frequent,
and now, again, more rare. The hills increased in
size and the bush thickened. Noon saw the traveller
in an &#8220;up-and-down&#8221; country intersected by icebound
streams and snow-laden hollows. The timber
became more heavy, great pine trees dominating the
more stunted growths, and darkening the outlook
by reason of their more generous vegetation. On
the eastern extremity of this belt of country stood
the school-house of Leonville; beyond that the
undulating prairie again on to Loon Dyke Farm.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></div>
<p>Leslie Grey looked at his watch; the hands indicated
a near approach to the hour of one. He had
yet three miles to go to reach his destination. He
had crossed a small creek. A culvert bridged it, but
the snow upon either side of the trail was so deep in
the hollow that no indication of the woodwork was
visible. It was in such places as these that a watchful
care was needed. The smallest divergence from
the beaten track would have precipitated the team
and cutter into a snow-drift from which it would have
been impossible to extricate it without a smash-up.
Once safely across this he allowed the horses to climb
the opposite ascent leisurely. They had done well&ndash;&ndash;he
had covered the distance in less than six hours.</p>
<p>The hill was a mass of redolent pinewoods. It
was as though the gradual densifying of this belt
of woodland country had culminated upon the hill.
The brooding gloom of the forest was profound.
The dark green foliage of the pines seemed black by
contrast with the snow, and gazing in amongst the
leafless lower trunks was like peering into a world of
dayless night The horses walked with ears pricked
and wistful eyes alertly gazing. The darkness of
their surroundings seemed to have conveyed something
of its mysterious dread to their sensitive nerves.
Tired they might be, but they were ready to shy at
each rustle of the heavy branches, as some stray
breath of air bent them lazily and forced from them a
creaking protest.</p>
<p>As the traveller neared the summit the trail
narrowed down until a hand outstretched from the
conveyance could almost have brushed the tree-trunks.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>Grey&#8217;s eyes were upon his horses and his thoughts
were miles away. Ahead of him gaped the opening
in the trees which marked the brow of the hill against
the skyline. He had traversed the road many times
on his way to Loon Dyke Farm and knew every foot
of it. It had no beauties for him. These profound
woods conveyed nothing to his unimpressionable
mind; not even danger, for fear was quite foreign to
his nature. This feeling of security was more the
result of his own lofty opinion of himself, and the
contempt in which he held all law-breakers, rather
than any high moral tone he possessed. Whatever
his faults, fear was a word which found no place in
his vocabulary. A nervous or imaginative man
might have conjured weird fancies from the gloom
with which he found himself surrounded at this point.
But Leslie Grey was differently constituted.</p>
<p>Now, as he neared the summit of the hill, he leant
slightly forward and gathered up the lines which he
had allowed to lie slack upon his horses&#8217; backs. A
resounding &#8220;chirrup&#8221; and the weary beasts strained
at their neck-yoke. Something moving in amongst
the trees attracted their attention. Their snorting
nostrils were suddenly thrown up in startled attention.
The off-side horse jumped sideways against its companion,
and the sleigh was within an ace of fouling
the trees. By a great effort Grey pulled the animals
back to the trail and his whip fell heavily across their
backs. Then he looked up to discover the cause of
their fright. A dark figure, a man clad in a black
sheepskin coat, stood like a statue between two
trees.</p>
<p>His right arm was raised and his hand gripped a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
levelled pistol. For one brief instant Grey surveyed
the apparition, and he scarcely realized his position.
Then a sharp report rang out, ear-piercing in the
grim silence, and his hands went up to his chest and
his eyes closed.</p>
<p>The next moment the eyes, dull, almost unseeing,
opened again, he swayed forward as though in great
pain, then with an effort he flung himself backwards,
settling himself against the unyielding back of the
seat; his face looked drawn and grey, nor did he
attempt to regain the reins which had dropped from
his hands. The horses, unrestrained, broke into a
headlong gallop; fright urged them on and they
raced down the trail, keeping to the beaten track
with their wonted instinct, even although mad with
fear. A moment later and the sleigh disappeared
over the brow of the hill.</p>
<p>All became silent again, except for the confused,
distant jangle of the sleigh-bells on the horses&#8217; backs.
The dark figure moved out on to the trail, and
stood gazing after the sleigh. For a full minute
he stood thus. Then he turned again and swiftly
became lost in the black depths whence he had so
mysteriously appeared.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>GREY&#8217;S LAST WORDS</h3>
</div>
<p>Rigid, hideous, stands the Leonville school-house
sharply outlined against the sky, upon the summit of
a high, rising ground. It stands quite alone as though
in proud distinction for its classic vocation. Its flat,
uninteresting sides; its staring windows; its high-pitched
roof of warped shingles; its weather-boarding,
innocent of paint; its general air of neglect; these
things strike one forcibly in that region of Nature&#8217;s
carefully-finished handiwork.</p>
<p>However, its cheerless aspect was for the moment
rendered less apparent than usual by reason of many
people gathered about the storm-porch, and the
number and variety of farmers&#8217; sleighs grouped about
the two tying-posts which stood by the roadside in
front of it An unbroken level of smooth prairie
footed one side of the hill, whilst at the back of the
house stretched miles of broken, hilly woodland.</p>
<p>The wedding party had arrived from Loon Dyke
Farm. Hephzibah Malling had gathered her friends
together, and all had driven over for the happy event
amidst the wildest enthusiasm and excited anticipation.
Each girl, clad in her brightest colours
beneath a sober outer covering of fur, was accompanied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
by her attendant swain, the latter well oiled about the
hair and well bronzed about the face, and glowing as
an after-effect of the liberal use of soap and water.
A wedding was no common occurrence, and, in
consequence, demanded special mark of appreciation.
No work would be done that day by any of those
who attended the function.</p>
<p>But the enthusiasm of the moment had died out at
the first breath of serious talk&ndash;&ndash;talk inspired by the
non-appearance of the bridegroom. The hour of the
ceremony was close at hand and still he had not
arrived. He should have been the first upon the
scene. The elders were agitated, the younger folk
hopeful and full of excuses for the belated groom, the
Minister fingered his great silver timepiece nervously.
He had driven over from Lakeville, at much inconvenience
to himself, to officiate at the launching of his
old friend&#8217;s daughter upon the high seas of wedded
life.</p>
<p>The older ladies had rallied to Mrs. Malling&#8217;s side.
The younger people held aloof. There was an
ominous grouping and eager whispering, and eyes
were turned searchingly upon the grey trail which
stretched winding away towards the western horizon.</p>
<p>The Rev. Charles Danvers, the Methodist minister
of Lakeville, was the central figure of the situation,
and at whom the elder ladies fired their comments
and suggestions. There could be no doubt, from the
nature and tone of these remarks, that a panic was
spreading.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite too bad, you know,&#8221; said Mrs. Covill, an
iron-grey haired lady of decided presence and
possessing a hooked nose. &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand it in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
a man of Mr. Grey&#8217;s business-like ways. Now he&#8217;s
just the sort of man whom I should have expected
would have been here at least an hour before it was
necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is just his sort that fail on these occasions,&#8221;
put in Mrs. Ganthorn pessimistically. &#8220;He&#8217;s just too
full of business for my fancy. What is the time now,
Mr. Danvers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the stroke of the half-hour,&#8221; replied the
parson, with a gloomy look. &#8220;My eyesight is not
very good; can I see anything on the trail, or is that
black object a bush?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bush,&#8221; said some one shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; ejaculated the parson. Then he turned to
Mrs. Malling, who stood beside him staring down the
trail with unblinking eyes. Her lips were pursed
and twitching nervously. &#8220;There can have been
no mistake about the time, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mistake? No,&#8221; retorted the good lady with
irritation. &#8220;Folks don&#8217;t make no mistake about the
hour of their wedding. Not the bridegroom, anyway.
No, it&#8217;s an accident, that&#8217;s what it is, as sure as my
name&#8217;s Hephzibah Malling. And that&#8217;s what comes
of his staying at Ainsley when he ought to have been
hereabouts. To think of a man driving forty odd
miles to get married. La&#8217; sakes! It just makes me
mad with him. There&#8217;s my girl there most ready to
cry her eyes out on her wedding morning, and small
blame to her neither. It&#8217;s a shame, and I&#8217;m not the
one to be likely to forget to tell him so when he
comes along. If he were my man he&#8217;d better his
ways, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one replied to the old lady&#8217;s heated complaint.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
They all too cordially agreed with her to defend the
recalcitrant bridegroom. Mr. Danvers drew out his
watch for at least the twentieth time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Five minutes overdue,&#8221; he murmured. Then
aloud and in a judicial tone: &#8220;We must allow him
some margin. But, as you say, it certainly was a
mistake his remaining at Ainsley.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mistake&ndash;&ndash;mistake, indeed,&#8221; Mrs. Malling retorted,
with all the scorn she was capable of. &#8220;He&#8217;s that
fool-headed that he won&#8217;t listen to no reason. Why
couldn&#8217;t he have stopped at the farm? Propriety&ndash;&ndash;
fiddlesticks!&#8221; Her face was flushed and her brow
ominously puckered; she folded her fat hands with
no uncertain grip across the slight frontal hollow
which answered her purpose for a waist. Her anger
was chiefly based upon alarm, and that alarm was
not alone for her daughter. She was anxious for the
man himself, and her anxiety found vent in that
peculiar angry protest which is so little meant by
those who resort to it. The good dame was on pins
and needles of nervous suspense. Had Grey suddenly
appeared upon the scene doubtless her kindly
face would have at once wreathed itself into a broad
expanse of smiles. But the moments flew by and
still the little group waited for the coming which was
so long delayed.</p>
<p>Three of the young men approached the agitated
mother from the juvenile gathering. Their faces
were solemn. Their own optimism had given way
before the protracted delay. Tim Gleichen and
Peter Furrers came first, Andy, the choreman, brought
up the rear.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been thinking,&#8221; said Tim, feeling it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
necessary to explain the process which had brought
them to a certain conclusion, &#8220;that maybe we might
just drive down the trail to see if we can see anything
of him, Mrs. Malling. Ye can&#8217;t just say how things
have gone with him. Maybe he&#8217;s struck a &#8216;dump&#8217;
and his sleigh&#8217;s got smashed up. There&#8217;s some tidy
drifts to come through, and it&#8217;s dead easy to get
dumped in &#8217;em. Peter and Andy here have volunteered
to go with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s real sensible of you, Tim,&#8221; replied Mrs.
Malling, with an air of relief. She felt quite convinced
that an accident had happened. She turned
to the minister. In this matter she considered he
was the best judge. Like many of her neighbours,
she looked to the minister as the best worldly as well
as spiritual adviser of his flock. &#8220;Like as not the
boys will be able to help him?&#8221; she suggested, in a
tone of inquiry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I should let them go yet,&#8221; the man
of the cloth replied. &#8220;I should give him an hour.
It seems to me it will be time enough then. Ah,
here&#8217;s Mrs. Gurridge,&#8221; as that lady appeared in the
doorway. &#8220;There&#8217;s no sign of him,&#8221; he called out in
anticipation of her inquiry. &#8220;I hope you are not
letting the bride worry too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too dreadful,&#8221; said Mrs. Ganthorn, as her
thoughts reverted to Prudence waiting in the school-ma&#8217;am&#8217;s
sitting-room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever can have happened to him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what&#8217;s been troubling us this hour and
more,&#8221; snapped the girl&#8217;s mother. She was in no
humour to be asked silly questions, however little they
were intended to be answered.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>She turned to Sarah. In this trouble the peaceful
Sarah would act as oil on troubled waters.</p>
<p>Sarah understood her look of inquiry.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s bearing up bravely, Hephzibah. She&#8217;s not
one of the crying sort. Too much of your Silas in
her for that. I&#8217;ve done my best to console her.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not say that she had propounded several
mottos more or less suitable to the occasion, which
had been delivered with great unction to the disconsolate
girl. Prudence had certainly benefited by the
good woman&#8217;s company, but not in the way Sarah had
hoped and believed. It was the girl&#8217;s own sense of
humour which had helped her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Malling turned away abruptly. Her red face
had grown a shade paler, and her round, brown eyes
were suspiciously watery. But she gazed steadily
down the trail on which all her hopes were set. The
guests stood around in respectful silence. The party
which had arrived so light-heartedly had now become
as solemn as though they had come to attend a
funeral. The minister continued to glance at his
watch from time to time. He had probably never in
his life so frequently referred to that faithful companion
of his preaching hours. Tim Gleichen and
Peter Furrers and Andy had moved off in the direction
of the sleighs. The others followed Mrs. Malling&#8217;s
example and bent their eyes upon the vanishing point
of the trail.</p>
<p>Suddenly an ejaculation escaped one of the
bystanders. Something moving had just come into
view. All eyes concentrated upon a black speck
which was advancing rapidly in a cloud of ground
snow. Hope rose at a bound to wild, eager delight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
The object was a sleigh. And the speed at which it
was coming down the trail told them that it was
bearing the belated bridegroom, who, conscious of his
fault, was endeavouring to make up the lost time.
Mrs. Malling&#8217;s round face shone again in her relief,
and a sigh of content escaped her. Word was sent
at once to the bride, and all was enthusiasm again.
Then followed a terrible shock. Peter Furrer, more
long-sighted than the rest, delivered it in a boorish
fashion all his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t no one aboard of that sleigh,&#8221; he called
out. &#8220;Say, them plugs is just boltin&#8217;. Gum, but they
be comin&#8217; hell-belt-fer-leckshuns.&#8221; Every one understood
his expression, and faces that a moment before
had been radiant with hope changed their expression
with equal suddenness to doubt, then in a moment to
apprehension.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Mrs. Malling gasped; it was
all she could say.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; The minister got no further, and
he fingered his watch from force of habit.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; some one said and broke off. Then
followed an excited murmur. &#8220;What&#8217;s Peter going
to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>The young giant had darted off down the trail in
the direction of the approaching sleigh. He lurched
heavily over the snow, his ungainly body rolling to
his gait, but he was covering ground in much the
same way that a racing elephant might. His stride
carried him along at a great pace. The onlookers
wondered and exclaimed, their gaze alternating in
amazement between the two objects, the oncoming
sleigh and the huge lurching figure of the boy.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></div>
<p>Now the sleigh was near enough for them to note
the truth of Peter&#8217;s statement. The horses, ungoverned
by any guiding hand, were tearing along at a desperate
pace. The cutter bumped and swayed in a threatening
manner; now it was lifted bodily from the trail as
its runners struck the banked sides of the furrows;
now it balanced on one side, hovering between overturning
and righting itself, now on the other; then
again it would jerk forward with a rush on to the
heels of the affrighted horses with maddening effect.
The poor brutes stretched themselves wildly to escape
from their terror. On they came amidst a whirl of
flying snow, and Peter had halted beside the trail
awaiting them.</p>
<p>Those who were watching saw the boy move outside
the beaten track. Already the panting of the
runaways could be heard by those looking on. If the
animals were not stayed in their mad career they
must inevitably crash into the school-house or collide
with the sleighs at the tying-posts. There was no
chance of their leaving the beaten trail, for they were
prairie horses.</p>
<p>Some of the men, as the realization of this fact
dawned upon them, hurried away to remove their
possessions to some more secure position, but most of
them remained gaping at the runaway team.</p>
<p>Now they saw Peter crouch down, beating the
snow under his feet to give himself a firm footing.
Barely fifty yards separated him from the sleigh. He
settled himself into an attitude as though about to
spring. Nearer drew the sleigh. The boy&#8217;s position
was fraught with the greatest danger. The onlookers
held their breath. What did he contemplate? Peter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
had methods peculiar to himself, and those who looked
wondered. Nearer&ndash;&ndash;nearer came the horses. A
moment more and the boy was lost in the cloud of
snow which rose beneath the horses&#8217; speeding feet. A
sigh broke from many of the ladies as they saw him
disappear. Then, next, there came an exclamation of
relief as they saw his bulky figure struggling wildly to
draw himself up over the high back of the sleigh. It
was no easy task, but Peter&#8217;s great strength availed
him. They saw him climb over and stand upon the
cushion, then, for a moment, he looked down as though
in doubt.</p>
<p>At last he leaned forward, and, laying hold of the
rail of the incurved dashboard, he climbed laboriously
out on to the setting of the sleigh&#8217;s tongue. The
flying end of one of the reins was waving annoyingly
beyond his reach. He ventured out further, still
holding to the dashboard, which swayed and bent
under the unaccustomed weight. Suddenly he made
a grab and caught the elusive strap and overbalanced
in the effort. He came within an ace of falling, but
was saved by lurching on to the quarters of one of
the horses. With a struggle he recovered himself
and regained the sleigh. The rest was the work of a
few seconds.</p>
<p>Bracing himself, he leant his whole weight on the
single rein. The horses swerved at once, and leaving
the trail plunged into the deep snow. The frantic
animals fell, recovered themselves, and floundered on,
then with a great jolt the sleigh turned over. Peter
shot clear of the wreck, but with experience of such
capsizes, he clung tenaciously to the rein. He was
dragged a few yards; then, trembling and ready to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
start off again at a moment&#8217;s notice, the jaded beasts
stood.</p>
<p>There was a rush of men to Peter&#8217;s assistance. The
women followed. But the latter never reached the
sleigh. Something clad in the brown fur of the
buffalo was lying beside the trail where the cutter had
overturned. Here they came to a stand, and found
themselves gazing down upon the inanimate form of
Leslie Grey.</p>
<p>It was a number of the younger ladies of the party
who reached the injured man first; the Furrer girls
and one of the Miss Covills. They paused abruptly
within a couple of yards of the fur-clad object and
craned forward, gazing down at it with horrified eyes.
The next minute they were thrust aside by the parson.
He came, followed by Mrs. Malling.</p>
<p>In a moment he had thrown himself upon his knees
and was looking into the pallid face of the prostrate
man, and almost unconsciously his hand pushed itself
in through the fastenings of the fur coat. He withdrew
it almost instantly, giving vent to a sharp
exclamation. It was covered with blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand back, please, everybody,&#8221; he commanded.</p>
<p>He was obeyed implicitly. But his order came
too late. They had seen the blood upon his hand.</p>
<p>Miss Ganthorn began to faint and was led away.
Other girls looked as though they might follow suit.
Only Hephzibah Malling stood her ground. Her
face was blanched, but her mouth was tightly clenched.
She uttered no sound. All her anger against the
prostrate man had vanished; a world of pity was in
her eyes as she silently looked on.</p>
<p>The parson summoned some of the men.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Bear a hand, boys,&#8221; he said, in a business-like
tone which deceived no one. &#8220;We&#8217;d better get him
into the house.&#8221; Then, seeing Mrs. Malling, he went
on, &#8220;Get Prudence away at once. She must not
see.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old farm-wife hurried off, and the others gently
raised the body of the unconscious man and bore it
towards the house.</p>
<p>Thus did Leslie Grey attend his wedding.</p>
<p>The body was taken in by a back way to Sarah
Gurridge&#8217;s bedroom and laid upon the bed. Tim
Gleichen was dispatched at once to Lakeville for the
doctor. Then, dismissing everybody but Harry
Gleichen, Mr. Danvers proceeded to remove the sick
man&#8217;s outer clothing.</p>
<p>The room was small, the one window infinitely so.
A single sunbeam shone coldly in through the latter
and lit up the well-scrubbed bare floor. There was
nothing but the plainest of &#8220;fixings&#8221; in the apartment,
but they had been set in position by the deft
hand of a woman of taste. The bed on which the
unconscious man had been placed was narrow and
hard. Its coverlet was a patchwork affair of depressing
hue.</p>
<p>Mr. Danvers bent to his work with a full appreciation
of the tragedy which had happened. His face
was solemn, and expressive of the most tender solicitude
for the injured man. In a whisper he dispatched
his assistant for warm water and bandages, whilst he
unfastened and removed the fur coat. Inside the
clothing was saturated with still warm blood. The
minister&#8217;s lips tightened as the truth of what had
happened slowly forced itself upon his mind.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></div>
<p>So absorbed was he in his ministrations that he
failed to heed the sound of excited whisperings which
came to him from beyond the door. It was not until
the creaking of the hinges had warned him that the
door was ajar, that he looked up from his occupation.
At that moment there was a rustle of silk, the noise
of swift footsteps across the bare boards, and Prudence
was at the opposite side of the bed.</p>
<p>The soft oval of the girl&#8217;s face was drawn, and deep
lines of anxious thought had broken up the smooth
expanse of her forehead. Her eyes seemed to be
straining out of their sockets, and the whites were
bloodshot. She did not speak, but her look displayed
an anguish unspeakable. Her eyes were
turned upon the face of the prostrate man; she did
not appear to see the minister. Her look suggested
some mute question, which seemed to pass from her
troubled eyes to the silent figure. Watching her,
Danvers understood that, for the present, it would
be dangerous to break the dreadful silence that held
her. He stooped again and drew back the waistcoat
and began to cut away the under-garments from
Grey&#8217;s chest.</p>
<p>Swiftly as the minister&#8217;s deft fingers moved about
the man&#8217;s body, his thoughts travelled faster. He
was not a man given to morbid sentimentality; his
calling demanded too much of the practical side of
human nature. He was there to aid his flock, materially
as well as spiritually, but at the moment he felt
positively sick in the stomach with sorrow and pity
for the woman who stood like a statue on the other
side of what he knew to be this man&#8217;s deathbed. He
dared not look over at her again. Instead, he bent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
his head lower and concentrated his, mind on the
work before him.</p>
<p>The silence continued, broken only by an occasional
heavy gasp of breath from the girl. The dripping
shirt was cut clear of the man&#8217;s chest, and the woollen
under-shirt was treated in a similar manner. The
exposed flesh was crimson with the blood which was
slowly oozing from a small wound a few inches higher
up in the chest than where the heart was so faintly
beating. One glance sufficed to tell the parson that
medical aid would be useless. The wound was
through the lungs.</p>
<p>For a moment he hesitated. His better sense
warned him to keep silence, but pity urged him to
speak. Pity swayed him with the stronger hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is alive,&#8221; he said. And the next moment he
regretted his words.</p>
<p>The tension of the girl&#8217;s dreadful expression relaxed
instantly. It was as the lifting of a dead weight
which had crushed her heart within her. She had
been numbed, paralyzed. Actual suffering had not
been hers, she had experienced a suspension of feeling
which had resulted from the shock. But that
suspension was far more dreadful than the most acute
suffering. Her whole soul had asked her senses,
&#8220;What is it?&#8221; and the waiting for the answer had
been to her in the nature of a blank.</p>
<p>The minister&#8217;s low murmured sentence had supplied
her with an answer. &#8220;He is alive.&#8221; The words
touched the springs of life within her and a glad
flush swept over her straining nerves. Reason once
more resumed its sway, and thought flowed through
her brain in an unchecked torrent It seemed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
Prudence as though some barrier had suddenly shut
off the simple life which had always been hers, and
had opened out for her a fresh existence in which she
found herself alone with the still, broken body of her
lover. For one brief instant her lips quivered, and a
faint in-catching of the breath told of the woman,
which, at the first return of feeling, had leapt uppermost
in her. But before the maturity of emotion
brought about the breakdown, a calm strength came to
her aid and steadied her nerves and checked the tears
which had so suddenly come into her eyes. Women
are like this. At a crisis in sickness they rise
superior to all emotion. When the crisis is past,
whether for good or ill, it is different.</p>
<p>The water was brought, and the minister set about
cleaning the discoloured flesh, while Prudence looked
on in silence. She was very pale, and her eyes were
painfully bright. While her gaze followed the gentle
movements of the minister, her thoughts were running
swiftly over the scenes of her life in which the
wounded man had played his part. She remembered
every look of the now closed eyes, and every expression
of his well-loved features. She called to mind
his words of hope, and the carefully-laid plans for his
advancement. Nor was there any taint of his selfishness
in her recollection of these things. Everything
about him, to her, was good and true. She loved him
with all the passionate intensity of one who had only
just attained to perfect womanhood. He had been to
her something of a hero, by reason of his headstrong,
dominating ways&ndash;&ndash;ways which more often attract the
love of woman in the first flush of her youth than in
her maturer, more experienced years.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></div>
<p>The sponging cleaned the flesh of the ghastly
stain, and the small wound with its blackened rim
lay revealed in all its horrid significance. The girl&#8217;s
eyes fixed themselves on it, and for some seconds
she watched the blood as it welled up to the
surface. The meaning of the puncture forced itself
slowly upon her mind, and she realized that it
was no accident which had laid her lover low.
Her eyes remained directed towards the crimson
flow, but their expression had changed, as had
the set of her features. A hard, relentless look had
replaced the one of tender pity&ndash;&ndash;a look which indexed
a feeling more strong than any other in
the human organism. She was beginning to understand
now that a crime had been committed, and
a vengeful hate for some person unknown possessed
her.</p>
<p>She pointed at the wound, and her voice sounded
icily upon the stillness of the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They have murdered him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has been shot.&#8221; The parson looked up into
the girl&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>Then followed a pause. Sarah Gurridge and
Prudence&#8217;s mother stole softly in and approached the
bedside. The former carried a tumbler of brandy in
her hand and came to Mr. Danvers&#8217;s side; Mrs.
Malling ranged herself beside her daughter, but the
latter paid no heed to her.</p>
<p>The farm-wife lifted the girl&#8217;s hand from the bedpost
and caressed it in loving sympathy. Then she
endeavoured to draw her away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, child, come with me. You can do no good
here.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></div>
<p>Prudence shook her off roughly. Nor did she
answer. Her mother did not renew her attempt.</p>
<p>All watched while Danvers forced some of the
spirit between Grey&#8217;s tightly-closed lips and then
stood up to note the effect.</p>
<p>He was actuated by a single thought. He knew
that the man was doomed, but he hoped that consciousness
might be restored before the tiny spark of
life burnt itself out. There was something to be
said if human aid could give the dying man the
power to say it. Prudence seemed to understand
the minister&#8217;s motive, for she vaguely nodded her
approval as she saw the spirit administered.</p>
<p>All waited eagerly for the sign of life which the
stimulating properties of the spirit might reveal. The
girl allowed her thoughts to drift away to the lonely
trail over which her lover had driven. She saw in
fancy the crouching assailants firing from the cover
of some wayside bluff. She seemed to hear many
shots, to see the speeding horses, to hear the dull
sound of the fatal bullet as her man was hit. She
pictured to herself the assassins, with callous indifference,
as the cutter passed out of view, mounting their
horses and riding away. Her thoughts had turned
to the only criminals she understood&ndash;&ndash;horse-thieves.</p>
<p>The sign of life which had been so anxiously
awaited came at last. It was apparent in the flicker
of the wax-like eyelids; in the faintest of sighs from
between the colourless lips. Danvers bent again over
the dying man and administered more of the spirit
It took almost instantaneous effect. The eyelids half
opened and the mouth distinctly moved. The action
was like that of one who is parched with thirst. Grey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
gasped painfully, and a strange rattle came from his
throat.</p>
<p>Danvers shook his head as he heard the sound.
Prudence, whose eyes had never left the dying man&#8217;s
face, spoke sharply. She voiced a common thought
&#8220;Who did it, Leslie?&#8221;</p>
<p>The minister nodded approval. For a moment his
eyes rested admiringly on the girl&#8217;s eager face. Her
courage astonished him. Then, as he read her expression
aright, his wonder lessened. The gulf is
bridged by a single span at the point of transition
from the girl to the woman. He understood that she
had crossed that bridge.</p>
<p>Grey struggled to speak, but only succeeded in
uttering an inarticulate sound. The minutes dragged.
The suspense was dreadful. They all realized that
he was fast sinking, but in every heart was a hope
that he would speak, would say one word which
might give some clue to what had happened.</p>
<p>The minister applied the rest of the brandy. The
dying man&#8217;s breathing steadied. The eyes opened
wider. Prudence leaned forward. Her whole soul
was in the look she bestowed upon the poor drawn
face, and in the tones of her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leslie, Leslie, speak to me. My poor, poor boy.
Tell me, how did it happen? Who did it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man gasped in response. He seemed to be
making one last great struggle against the overwhelming
weakness which was his. His head moved
and a feeble cough escaped his lips. The girl put her
arm under his head and slightly raised it, and the
dying eyes looked into hers. She could no longer
find words to utter; great passionate sobs shook her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
slight frame, and scalding tears coursed down her
cheeks and fell upon the dingy coverlet.</p>
<p>A whistling breath came from between the dying
man&#8217;s parted lips, and culminated in a hoarse rattling
in his throat. Then his body moved abruptly, and
one arm lifted from the elbow-joint, the head half
turned towards the girl, and words distinct, but halting,
came from the working lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&ndash;&ndash;he&ndash;&ndash;did&ndash;&ndash;it. <i>Free&ndash;&ndash;P&ndash;&ndash;Press</i>. Yell&ndash;&ndash;ow&ndash;&ndash;G&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; The
last word died away to a gurgle. A
violent fit of coughing seized the dying man, then it
ceased suddenly. His head weighed like lead upon
the girl&#8217;s supporting hand, and a thin trickle of blood
bubbled from the corners of his mouth. Prudence
withdrew her arm from beneath him and replaced the
head upon the pillow. Her tears had ceased to flow
now.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is dead,&#8221; she said with studied calmness, as
she straightened herself up from the bed.</p>
<p>She moved a step or two away. Then she paused
uncertainly and gazed about her like one dazed. Her
mother went towards her, but before she reached her
side Prudence uttered a strange, wild cry and rushed
from the room, tearing wildly at the fastenings of her
silk dress as though to rid herself of the mocking
reminder of that awful day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>LONELY RANCH AT OWL HOOT</h3>
</div>
<p>In spite of the recent tragic events the routine of
the daily life at Loon Dyke Farm was very little interfered
with. Just for a few weeks following upon
the death of Leslie Grey the organization of Mrs.
Malling&#8217;s household had been thrown out of gear.</p>
<p>The coming of the police and the general scouring
of the country for the murderers of the Customs
officer had entailed a &#8220;nine days&#8217; wonder&#8221; around
the countryside, and had helped to disturb the wonted
peace of the farm. But the search did not last long.
Horse-thieves do not wait long in a district, and the
experience of the &#8220;riders of the plains&#8221; taught them
that it would be useless to pursue where there was no
clue to guide them. The search was abandoned after
a while, and the dastardly murder remained an unsolved
mystery.</p>
<p>The shock to Prudence&#8217;s nervous system had been
a terrible one, and a breakdown, closely bordering
upon brain fever, had followed. The girl&#8217;s condition
had demanded the utmost care, and, in this matter,
Sarah Gurridge had proved herself a loyal friend. Dr.
Parash, with conscientious soundness of judgment, had
ordered her removal for a prolonged sojourn to city
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
life in Toronto; a course which, in spite of heartbroken
appeal on the girl&#8217;s part, her mother insisted upon
carrying out with Spartan-like resolution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Broken hearts,&#8221; she had said to Sarah, during a
confidential chat upon the subject, &#8220;are only kept from
mending by them as talks sympathy. There isn&#8217;t
nothin&#8217; like mixing with folks what&#8217;s got their own
troubles to worrit over. She&#8217;ll get all that for sure
when she gets to one o&#8217; them cities. Cities is full of
purgat&#8217;ry,&#8221; she added profoundly. &#8220;I shall send her
down to sister Emma, she&#8217;s one o&#8217; them hustlin&#8217;
women that&#8217;ll never let the child rest a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Sarah had approved feelingly.</p>
<p>So Prudence was safely dispatched eastwards for
an indefinite period before the spring opened. But
Hephzibah Malling had yet to realize that her daughter
had suddenly developed from a child, who looked
to her mother&#8217;s guidance in all the more serious questions
of life, into a woman of strong feelings and
opinions. This swift casting off of the fetters of childhood
had been the work of those few passionate
moments at the bedside of her dying lover.</p>
<p>Prudence had submitted to the sentence which her
mother, backed by the doctor&#8217;s advice, had passed, and
she went away. But in complying with the order she
had performed the last act which childhood&#8217;s use had
prompted. The period of her absence was indefinite.
The fiat demanded no limitation to her stay with
&#8220;sister&#8221; Emma. She could return when she elected
so to do. Bred in the pure air of the prairie, no city
could claim her for long. And so she returned to the
farm against all opposition within two months of
leaving it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></div>
<p>The spring brought another change to the farm, a
change which was as welcome to the old farm-wife as
the opening of the spring itself. Hervey returned
from Niagara, bringing with him the story of the
failure of his mission. True to herself and the
advice of Iredale, Hephzibah made her proposition
to her son, with the result that, with some show of
distaste, he accepted the situation, and with his
three-legged companion took up his abode at the
farm.</p>
<p>And so the days lengthened and the summer heat
increased; the hay in the sloughs ripened and
filled the air with its refreshing odours; the black
squares of ploughed land were quickly covered with
the deepening carpet of green, succulent grain; the
wild currant-bushes flowered, and the choke-cherries
ripened on the laden branches, and the deep blue
vault of the heavens smiled down upon the verdant
world.</p>
<p>George Iredale again became a constant and welcome
visitor at the farm, nor in her leisure did Sarah
Gurridge seek relaxation in any other direction.</p>
<p>The morning was well advanced. The air was still
and very hot. There was a peaceful drowsiness about
the farm buildings and yard which was only broken by
the occasional squeal of the mouching swine routing
amongst any stray garbage their inquisitive eyes
happened to light upon. The upper half of the barn
door stood open, and in the cool shade of the interior
could be seen the outline of dark, well-rounded forms
looming between the heel-posts of the stalls which
lined the side walls. An occasional impatient stamp
from the heavily-shod hoofs told of the capacity for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
annoyance of the ubiquitous fly or aggravating mosquito,
whilst the steady grinding sound which pervaded
the atmosphere within, and the occasional
&#8220;gush&#8221; of distended nostrils testified to healthy
appetites, and noses buried in mangers well filled with
sweet-smelling &#8220;Timothy&#8221; hay.</p>
<p>The kitchen doorway was suddenly filled with the
ample proportions of Hephzibah Malling. She moved
out into the open. She was carrying a large pail
filled with potato-parings and other fragments of
culinary residuum. A large white sun-bonnet protected
her grey head and shaded her now flaming
face from the sun, and her dress, a neat study in
grey, was enveloped in a huge apron.</p>
<p>She moved out to a position well clear of the
buildings and began to call out in a tone of persuasive
encouragement&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tig&ndash;&ndash;tig&ndash;&ndash;tig! Tig&ndash;&ndash;tig&ndash;&ndash;tig!&#8221;</p>
<p>She repeated her summons several times, then
moved on slowly, continuing to call at intervals.</p>
<p>The swine gathered with a hungry rush at her
heels, and their chorus of acclamation drowned her
familiar cry. Passing down the length of the barn
she reached a cluster of thatched mud hovels. Here
she opened the crazy gate to admit her clamorous
flock, and then deposited the contents of her pail in
the trough provided for that purpose. The pigs
fell-to with characteristic avidity, complaining vociferously
the while as only pigs will.</p>
<p>She stood for a few moments looking down at her
noisy charges with calculating eyes. It was a fine
muster of young porkers, and the old lady was estimating
their bacon-yielding capacity.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>Suddenly her reflections were interrupted by the
sound of footsteps, and turning, she saw Hervey
crossing the yard in the direction of the creamery.
She saw him disappear down the steps which led to
the door, for the place was in the nature of a dugout
She sighed heavily and moved away from
her porkers, and slowly she made her way to the
wash-house. The sight of this man had banished all
her feelings of satisfaction. Her son was a constant
trouble to her; a source of grave worry and anxiety.
Her hopes of him had been anything but fulfilled.</p>
<p>In the meantime Hervey had propped himself
against the doorway of the creamery and was talking
to his sister within. The building, like all dugouts,
was long and low; its roof was heavily thatched
to protect the interior from the effects of the sun&#8217;s
rays. Prudence was moving slowly along the two
wide counters which lined the walls from one end to
the other. Each counter was covered with a number
of huge milk-pans, from which the girl was carefully
skimming the thick, yellow cream. She worked
methodically; and the rich fat dropped with a heavy
&#8220;plonk&#8221; into the small pail she carried, in a manner
which testified to the quality of the cream.</p>
<p>She looked a little paler than usual; the healthy
bloom had almost entirely disappeared from her
cheeks, and dark shadows surrounded her brown
eyes. But this was the only sign she displayed of
the tragedy which had come into her young life.
The trim figure was unimpaired, and her wealth of
dark hair was as carefully adjusted as usual. Hervey
watched his sister&#8217;s movements as she passed from
pan to pan.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Iredale wants me to ride over to Owl Hoot
to-day,&#8221; he said slowly. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to have an
afternoon&#8217;s &#8216;chicken shoot.&#8217; He says the prairie-chicken
round his place are as thick as mosquitoes.
He&#8217;s a lucky beggar. He seems to have the best of
everything. I&#8217;ve scoured our farm all over and
there&#8217;s not so much as a solitary grey owl to get a
pot at. I hate the place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence ceased working and faced him. She
scornfully looked him up and down. At that
moment she looked very picturesque with her black
skirt turned up from the bottom and pinned about
her waist, displaying an expanse of light-blue petticoat.
Her blouse was a simple thing in spotless
white cotton, with a black ribbon tied about her
neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you are very ungrateful, Hervey,&#8221; she
said quietly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve only been home for a few
months, and not a day has passed but what I&#8217;ve
heard you grumble about something in connection
with your home. If it isn&#8217;t the dulness it&#8217;s the
work; if it isn&#8217;t the work it&#8217;s your position of
dependence, or the distance from town, or the people
around us. Now you grumble because of the shooting.
What do you want? We&#8217;ve got a section and
a half, nearly a thousand acres, under wheat; we&#8217;ve
got everything that money can buy in the way of
improvements in machinery; we&#8217;ve got a home that
might fill many a town-bred man with envy, and a
mother who denies us nothing; and yet you aren&#8217;t
satisfied. What <i>do</i> you want? If things aren&#8217;t
what you like, for goodness&#8217; sake go back to the wilds
again, where, according to your own account, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
were happy. Your incessant grumbling makes me
sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A new departure, sister, eh?&#8221; Hervey retorted,
smiling unpleasantly. &#8220;I always thought it was
everybody&#8217;s privilege to grumble a bit. Still, I don&#8217;t
think it&#8217;s for you to start lecturing me if even it isn&#8217;t.
Mother&#8217;s treated me pretty well&ndash;&ndash;in a way. But
don&#8217;t forget she&#8217;s only hired me the same as she&#8217;s
hired Andy, or any of the rest of the hands. Why,
I haven&#8217;t even the same position as you have. I am
paid so many dollars a month, for which I have to
do certain work. Let me tell you this, my girl: if I
had stayed on this farm until father died my position
would have been very different. It would all have
been mine now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, since you didn&#8217;t do so, the farm is mother&#8217;s.&#8221;
Prudence&#8217;s pale cheeks had become flushed with
anger. &#8220;And I think, all things considered, she has
treated you particularly well.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she turned back to her work.</p>
<p>The girl was very angry, and justifiably so. Hervey
was lazy. The work which was his was rarely
done unless it happened to fall in with his plans for
the moment. He was thoroughly bearish to both his
mother and herself, and he had already overdrawn
the allowance the former had made him. All this
had become very evident to the girl since her return
to the farm, and it cut her to the quick that the
peace of her home should have been so rudely
broken. Even Prudence&#8217;s personal troubles were
quite secondary to the steady grind of Hervey&#8217;s ill-manners.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, after the first passing of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
shock of Grey&#8217;s death she found herself less stricken
than she would have deemed it possible. There
could be no doubt that she had loved the man in her
girlish, adoring fashion.</p>
<p>She had thought that never again could she return
to the place which had such dread memories for her.
Thoughts of the long summer days, and the dreary,
interminable winter, when the distractions of labour
are denied the farmer, had been revolting to her. To
live within a few miles of where that dreadful tragedy
had occurred; to live amongst the surroundings
which must ever be reminding her of her dead lover;
these things had made her shrink from the thought
of the time when she would again turn westward to
her home.</p>
<p>But when she had once more taken her place in
the daily life at the farm, it was, at first with a certain
feeling of self-disgust, and later with thankfulness,
that she learned that she could face her old life with
perfect equanimity. The childish passion for her
dead lover had died; the shock which had suddenly
brought about her own translation from girlhood to
womanhood had also dispelled the illusions of her
girlish first love.</p>
<p>She confided nothing to anybody, but just went
about her daily round of labours in a quiet, pensive
way, striving by every means to lighten her mother&#8217;s
burden and to help her brother to the path which
their father before them had so diligently trodden.</p>
<p>Her patience had now given way under the
wearing tide of Hervey&#8217;s dissatisfaction, and it
seemed as though a rupture between them were
imminent.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well enough, if you consider bare duty,&#8221;
Hervey retorted after a deliberate pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bare duty, indeed!&#8221; Prudence&#8217;s two brown eyes
flashed round on him in an instant. &#8220;You are the
sort of man who should speak of duty, Hervey. You
just ought to be ashamed of yourself. Your mother&#8217;s
debt of duty towards you was fulfilled on the day
you left the farm years ago. She provided you with
liberal capital to start you in life. Now you have
come back, and she welcomes you with open arms&ndash;&ndash;we
both do&ndash;&ndash;glad that you should be with us again.
And what return have you made to her for her goodness?
I&#8217;ll tell you; you have brought her nothing
but days of unhappiness with your lazy, grumbling
ways. If you are going to continue like this, for
goodness&#8217; sake go away again. She has enough on
her shoulders without being worried by you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man looked for a moment as though he were
going to give expression to some very nasty talk.
Prudence had returned to her pans and so lost the
evil glance of his expressive eyes. Then his look
changed to a mocking smile, and when he spoke his
words were decidedly conciliating.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve done something to offend you,
Prue. But you shouldn&#8217;t use hard words like that
I know I&#8217;m not much of a farmer, and I am always
a bit irritable when I am not my own master. But
don&#8217;t let&#8217;s quarrel. I wanted to talk to you about
George Iredale. He seems a jolly decent fellow&ndash;&ndash;much
too good to be kicking his heels about in such
a district as Owl Hoot. He&#8217;s extremely wealthy,
isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl felt angry still, but Hervey&#8217;s tone slightly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
mollified her. She answered shortly enough, and the
skimming of the milk was not done with the adeptness
which she usually displayed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rich? Yes, he&#8217;s one of the richest men in
Manitoba. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. He seems very interested in&ndash;&ndash;us.
He&#8217;s always over here. And he never by any
chance loses an opportunity of ingratiating himself
with mother. I wonder what his object is?&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence bent over her work to hide the tell-tale
flush which had spread over her face, and the skimming
was once more done with the utmost care.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother is very fond of Mr. Iredale,&#8221; she replied
slowly. &#8220;He is a good man, and a good friend.
We, as you know, are his nearest neighbours. Are
you going over there to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&ndash;&ndash;it doesn&#8217;t matter&ndash;&ndash;I was going to ask you
to ride over to Lakeville to ask Alice Gordon to
come here during the harvesting. She&#8217;s staying with
the Covills. But it doesn&#8217;t matter in the least, I
can send one of the boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, better send one of the boys. I&#8217;m going over
to Lonely Ranch. I shall cultivate Iredale; he&#8217;s the
only man I care about round here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence had nearly completed her operations and
was salting the cream in the pail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, sis, did it ever strike you that Iredale&#8217;s dead
sweet on you?&#8221; Hervey went on coarsely.</p>
<p>The girl suddenly turned and looked her brother
squarely in the face. Her brow was again flushed,
but now with anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll lose the best of your shooting if you don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
hurry. You&#8217;ve got ten miles to ride. And&ndash;&ndash;I am
going to lock up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her brother didn&#8217;t offer to move.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you do all this work?&#8221; he went on
calmly. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you send all the milk to the
Government creamery? It&#8217;ll save labour, and you get
market price for the produce.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because Government creameries are for those who
can&#8217;t afford to send their stuff to market, or make
their cheese on their farms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s the worst of being large farmers, it
entails so much work. By Jove! Iredale doesn&#8217;t
work like we &#8216;moss-backs&#8217; have to, and he&#8217;s made a
fortune. I guess if there were a Mrs. George Iredale
she&#8217;d have a bully time. No cheese- or butter-making,
eh, sis?&#8221; And, with a grin, Hervey turned on his
heel, and, passing up the steps, walked away towards
the barn.</p>
<p>Prudence waited until her brother had disappeared
within the stables; then she locked up. As she
turned from the door she heard her mother&#8217;s voice
calling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Girl&ndash;&ndash;girl, where are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here I am, mother dear, at the creamery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Malling trundled round the corner of the
house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prudence, there&#8217;s young Peter Furrer come over,
and I haven&#8217;t time to stop and gossip with him.
Like as not he don&#8217;t want to talk to a body like me,
anyway. Just drop that skirt o&#8217; yours, girl, and go
and see him. A nice time o&#8217; day to come a-courtin&#8217;.
He&#8217;ll be a-follerin&#8217; you to the grain fields when we&#8217;re
harvesting.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></div>
<p>Prudence smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, mother. He&#8217;s come at an opportune
moment. I want a messenger to go over to Lakeville.
He&#8217;ll do. I&#8217;m sending word to Alice Gordon.
I want her to come here for the harvesting. Alice
must get very sick of living at Ainsley, in spite of the
fact of her beau living there. I&#8217;ve a good mind to tell
her to bring him out here. Shan&#8217;t be long, dear;
I&#8217;ll join you directly. Where are you? In the wash-house?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl ran off, letting her skirt fall as she went
The mother passed on to the wash-house, muttering
to herself as she went.</p>
<p>&#8220;La, if he were only like her. But there, the Lord
ordains, and them as brings their offspring into the
world must abide the racket. But it goes hard with
a man about the house who idles. Mussy-a-me, he
ain&#8217;t like his poor father. And I&#8217;m not goin&#8217; to give
him no extra dollars to fling around in Winnipeg.
He&#8217;s too fond of loose company.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old lady continued to mutter audibly until she
reached the wash-house door, where she disappeared
just as the object of her thoughts led his horse out of
the barn, jumped on its back, and rode away.</p>
<p>It was noon when Hervey reached Owl Hoot.
He had been there several times lately, sometimes
at George Iredale&#8217;s invitation, but generally at his
own. He had his own particular reasons for cultivating
the owner of Lonely Ranch, and those
reasons he kept carefully to himself. This unworthy
son had only been at Loon Dyke Farm for little
more than four months, and during that brief period
he had plainly shown what manner of man he was.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>Even the doting affection of his mother had not
blinded that simple soul to his shortcomings. Each
month since his coming he had steadily overdrawn
his allowance to no inconsiderable extent. His
frequent visits to Winnipeg had always ended in
his return home with pockets empty, and an
accumulation of debts, of which he said nothing,
left behind him. Then came the inevitable request
for money, generally backed up by some plausible
excuse, and Hephzibah&#8217;s cheque-book was always
forthcoming on these occasions. But though, hitherto,
she had not failed him, he saw by her manner that
the time was not far distant when her sweet old
face would become curiously set, and the comely
mouth would shut tight, and the cheque-book would
remain locked in her wardrobe, while he poured his
flimsy excuses on stone-deaf ears.</p>
<p>He understood his mother. She would do much,
perhaps far too much for her children, but she would
not allow herself to be preyed upon; she was too keen
a business woman for that. Besides, his accumulation
of debts was now so great that all he was able to
bleed her for would be but a drop in the ocean. In
Winnipeg he posed as the owner of Loon Dyke Farm,
and as such his credit was extensive. But now there
were clamourings for settlements, and Hervey knew
that gaming debts and hotel bills must be met in due
course. Tradesmen can wait, they have redress from
owners of property, but the others have no such means
of repaying themselves, therefore they must be paid
if he wished to remain in the district. Now he meant
to raise what he required from Iredale. He had
recognized the fact that Iredale was in love with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
Prudence, nor was he slow to appreciate the possibilities
which this matter suggested as a money-raising
means. Yes, Hervey intended that Iredale
should pay for the privilege of enjoying his sister&#8217;s
society. Money he must have, and that at once.</p>
<p>It was a wild, desolate region which he rode
through on his way to Lonely Ranch. No one, finding
themselves suddenly dropped into the midst of
those wood-covered crags and clean-cut ravines, the
boulder-strewn, grassless land, would have dreamed
that they were within half-a-dozen miles of the
fertile prairie-lands of Canada. It was like a slum
hidden away in the heart of a fashionable city. The
country round the mysterious Lake of the Woods is
something utterly apart from the rest of the Canadian
world, and partakes much of the nature of the
Badlands of Dakota. It is tucked away in the
extreme south-eastern corner of Manitoba, and the
international boundary runs right through the heart
of it.</p>
<p>Lonely Ranch was situated in an abrupt hollow,
and was entirely lost to view in a mammoth growth
of pinewoods. Years ago a settlement had existed
in this region, but what the nature of that settlement
it was now impossible to tell. Local tradition
held that, at some far-distant period, the place
had been occupied by a camp of half-breed &#8220;bad-men&#8221;
who worked their evil trade upon the south
side of the American border, and sought security
in the shelter of this perfect hiding-place. Be that
as it may, it was now the abode of George Iredale,
rancher. He had built for himself a splendid house
of hewn logs, and his outbuildings&ndash;&ndash;many of them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
the restored houses of the early settlers&ndash;&ndash;and corrals
formed a ranch of very large dimensions.</p>
<p>And it was all hidden away in black woods which
defied the keenest observation of the passer-by. And
the hollow was approached by a circuitous road which
entered the cutting at its northern end. Any other
mode of ingress was impossible for any beast of
burden.</p>
<p>As Hervey entered the valley and became lost to
view in the sombre woods, he was greeted by the
woeful cry of a screech-owl. So sudden and unexpected
was the ear-piercing cry that both horse and
rider started. The horse threw up its head and
snorted, and stood for an instant trembling with
apprehension. Hervey looked about him keenly.
He could see nothing but the crowd of leafless tree-trunks,
and a bed of dry pine-cones which covered
the surrounding earth. The owl was probably hidden
in the hollow of some dead tree, for there were
many about. He pressed his horse forward. The
animal moved cautiously, dancing along in its nervous
apprehension.</p>
<p>Presently another cry split the air. Again some
owl had protested at his intrusion.</p>
<p>So suddenly did the cry come that Hervey felt
a slight superstitious quiver pass down his back, but
he rode on. He had nearly a mile of the valley to
travel before he came to the house, and, during the
journey, seven times came the hideous screech of
the owls. Now he began to understand why this
place was called &#8220;Owl Hoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was with a feeling of relief that he at length
saw the ranch through the trees, and he greeted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
Iredale, who was standing in his doorway when he
dismounted, with genuine pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, after shaking his host by the
hand, &#8220;another mile of this d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;d valley and I
should have turned tail and fled back to the open.
Why, you must have a regular colony of owls in
the place. Man, I never heard such weird cries
in my life. How is it that I haven&#8217;t heard them
before when I came here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale took his visitor&#8217;s horse. He was dressed in
moleskin. Underneath his loose, dun-coloured vest
he wore a soft shirt, and in place of a linen collar he
had a red bandana tied about his neck. His headgear
was a Stetson hat. In this garb he looked
much more burly and powerful than in the tweeds
he usually wore when visiting at the farm. His
strong, patient face was lit by a quiet smile. He
was a man whose eyes, and the expression of his
features, never betrayed his thoughts. A keen
observer would have noticed this at once, but to
such people as he encountered he merely appeared
a kindly man who was not much given to talking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Colony of owls, eh?&#8221; he said, leading the horse
in the direction of the barn. &#8220;Those cries you have
heard are what this cheerful place takes its name
from. It only needs one cry to set the whole valley
ringing with them. Had not the first creature seen
you approach you might have reached your destination
without hearing one disturbing sound. As a
rule, in the daytime, they are not heard, but at night
no one can enter these woods without the echoes
being aroused. When they begin to shriek there is
no sleep for any one in my house.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></div>
<p>&#8220;So I should say. Well, never mind them now,
we have other matters on hand. What coverts are we
going to shoot over first?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hervey had followed his host to the stable. A
strange-looking little creature came from the obscurity
within. He was an undersized man with a small
face, which seemed somehow to have shrivelled up
like a dead leaf. He had a pair of the smallest eyes
Hervey had ever seen, and not a vestige of hair on
his face. His head was covered with a crown of
bristly grey hair that seemed to grow in patches,
and his feet were both turned in one direction&ndash;&ndash;to
the right.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take this plug and give him a rub down, Chintz,&#8221;
said Iredale. &#8220;When he&#8217;s cool, water and feed him.
Mr. Malling won&#8217;t need him until about eight o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he turned towards the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;He don&#8217;t waste words,&#8221; observed Hervey, indicating
the man, who had silently disappeared into the
stable, taking the horse with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; he&#8217;s dumb,&#8221; replied Iredale. &#8220;He&#8217;s my head
boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Sixty-two.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men passed into Iredale&#8217;s sitting-room.
It was plainly but comfortably furnished in a typical
bachelor manner. There were more signs of the
owner&#8217;s sporting propensities in the room than anything
else, the walls being arranged with gun-racks,
fishing-tackle, and trophies of the chase.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll draw the bush on the other side of the
Front Hill, otherwise known as the &#8216;Haunted Hill,&#8217;&#8221;
said Iredale, pointing to a gun-rack. &#8220;Select your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
weapon. I should take a mixed bore&ndash;&ndash;ten and
twelve. We may need both. There are some geese
in a swamp over that way. The cartridges are in the
bookcase; help yourself to a good supply, and one
of those haversacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hervey did as his host suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why &#8216;Haunted Hill&#8217;?&#8221; he asked curiously.</p>
<p>Iredale shrugged.</p>
<p>&#8220;By reason of a little graveyard on the side of it.
Evidently where the early settlers buried their dead.
It is a local name given, I suppose, by the prairie folk
of your neighbourhood. Come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men set out. Nor did they return until
six o&#8217;clock. Their shoot was productive of a splendid
bag&ndash;&ndash;prairie chicken and geese. Both men were
excellent shots. Iredale was perhaps the better of
the two, at least his bag numbered two brace more
than that of his companion; but then, as Hervey told
himself, he was using a strange gun, whilst Iredale
was using the weapon he most favoured. Supper
was prepared by the time they returned to the house.
Iredale, healthily hungry and calmly contented, sat
down to the meal; Hervey, famished by his unusual
exercise, joined him in the loudest of good spirits.</p>
<p>Towards the close of the meal, when the whisky-and-water
Hervey had liberally primed himself with
had had due effect, he broached the subject that
was ever uppermost in his thoughts. He began
expansively&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, George,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he had already adopted the
familiarity, and Iredale had not troubled to show
disapproval, probably he remembered the relationship
between this man and Prudence,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I&#8217;m sick of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
farming. It&#8217;s too monotonous. Not only that; so
long as mother lives I am little better than a hired
man. Of course she&#8217;s very good,&#8221; he went on,
as he noted a sudden lowering of his companion&#8217;s
eyelids; &#8220;does no end for me, and all that sort of
thing; but my salary goes nowhere with a man who
has&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash;who has hitherto had considerable resources.
It&#8217;s no easy thing under the circumstances
to keep my expenses down. It seems such nonsense,
when one comes to think of it, that I, who will
eventually own the farm, subject, of course, to some
provision for Prue, have to put up with a trifling
allowance doled out to me every month; it&#8217;s really
monstrous. Who ever heard of a fellow living on
one hundred dollars a month! That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m
getting. Why, I owe more than five months&#8217; wages
at the Northern Union Hotel in Winnipeg. It can&#8217;t
be done; that&#8217;s all about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale looked over at the dark face opposite him.
Nor could he help drawing a comparison between the
man and the two ladies who owned him, one as
brother, the other as son. How utterly unlike them
he was in every way. There was not the smallest
resemblance in mind, face, or figure. His thoughts
reverted to Silas Malling, and here they paused.
Here was the resemblance of outward form; and he
wondered what unfathomed depths had lain in the
nature of the old farmer which could have communicated
themselves in such developed form to the son.
It was inconceivable that this indolent, selfish spendthrift
could have inherited his nature from Silas
Malling. No; he felt sure that some former ancestor
must have been responsible for it. He understood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
the drift of Hervey&#8217;s words in a twinkling. He had
experienced this sort of thing before from other men.
Now he did not discourage it.</p>
<p>&#8220;A hundred a month on the prairie should be a
princely&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;wage,&#8221; he said in his grave way. &#8220;Of
course it might be different in a city.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; said Hervey decidedly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,
I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; he went on, after a moment&#8217;s pause. &#8220;I
suppose I must weather through somehow.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked across at Iredale in such a definitely
meaning way that the latter had no hesitation in
speaking plainly. He knew it was money, and this
was Prudence&#8217;s brother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got into a&ndash;&ndash;mess?&#8221; he suggested encouragingly.</p>
<p>Hervey felt that he had an easy victim, but he
smoked pensively for a moment before he spoke,
keeping his great eyes turned well down upon the
table-cover.</p>
<p>&#8220;Um&ndash;&ndash;I lost a lot of money at poker the last time
I was in the city. I was in an awful streak of bad
luck; could do nothing right. Generally it&#8217;s the
other way about. Now they&#8217;re pressing me to redeem
the I.O.U.s. When they owe me I notice
they&#8217;re not so eager about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s bad; I&#8217;m sorry to hear it.&#8221; Iredale&#8217;s eyes
were smiling, whilst in their depths there was the
faintest suspicion of irony. He was in no way
imposed upon by the breadth of the fabrication. It
was the old story. He, too, lit his pipe and leant
back in his chair. &#8220;I hope the amount is not too
overwhelming. If I can&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;be&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Hervey interrupted him eagerly. He brought his
hand down heavily upon the table.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></div>
<p>&#8220;By Jove! you are a good sort, George. If you
could&ndash;&ndash;just a loan, of course&ndash;&ndash;you see I can offer you
security on my certain inheritance of the farm&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But Iredale had no wish to hear anything about
his future possibilities of inheritance. He interrupted
him sharply, and his tone was unusually icy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut&ndash;&ndash;tut, man. Never mind about that. In spite
of your need of money, I hope it will be many a year
before your mother leaves our farming world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust so,&#8221; murmured Hervey, without enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much will appease your creditors?&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale spoke with such indifference about the
amount that Hervey promptly decided to double the
sum he originally intended to ask for.</p>
<p>&#8220;Five thousand dollars,&#8221; he said, with some show
of diffidence, but with eyes that gazed hungrily
towards this man who treated the loaning of a large
amount in such a careless manner.</p>
<p>Iredale offered no comment. He merely rose from
his seat, and opening a drawer in his bookcase,
produced a cheque-book and a pen and ink. He
made out a cheque for the amount named, and
passed it across the table. His only remark was&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your luck may change. Pay me when you like.
No, don&#8217;t bother about a receipt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hervey seized upon the piece of paper. He was
almost too staggered to tender his thanks. Iredale
in his quiet way was watching, nor was any movement
on his companion&#8217;s part lost to his observant
eyes. He had &#8220;sized&#8221; this man up, from the soles of
his boots to the crown of his head, and his contempt
for him was profound. But he gave no sign. His
cordiality was apparently perfect. The five thousand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
dollars were nothing to him, and he felt that the
giving of that cheque might save those at Loon
Dyke Farm from a world of anxiety and trouble.
Somehow behind that impassive face he may have
had some thoughts of the coming of a future time
when he would be able to deal with this man&#8217;s mode
of life with that firmness which only relationship
could entitle him to&ndash;&ndash;when he could personally
relieve Hephzibah of the responsibility and wearing
anxiety of her worthless son&#8217;s doings. In the meantime,
like the seafaring man, he would just &#8220;stand by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t thank you enough, George,&#8221; said Hervey
at last. &#8220;You have got me out of an awkward
situation. If I can do you a good turn, I will.&#8221;
Iredale detected a meaning emphasis in the last
remark which he resented. &#8220;Some day,&#8221; the man
went on; &#8220;but there&ndash;&ndash;I will say no more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I shouldn&#8217;t say anything. These things
happen in the course of a lifetime, and one mustn&#8217;t
say too much about them.&#8221; The two men then
smoked on in silence.</p>
<p>Presently Hervey rose to go. It was nearly eight
o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Iredale, as he prepared to bid his
guest good-bye, &#8220;we have had a good afternoon&#8217;s
sport. Now you know my coverts you must come
over again. Come whenever you like. If I am
unable to go with you, you are welcome to shoot
over the land by yourself. There are some grand
antelope about the place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks. I shall certainly come again. And&ndash;&ndash;well,
when are you coming over to us again? I can&#8217;t
offer you any shooting.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t trouble,&#8221; smiled Iredale.</p>
<p>Hervey saw the &#8220;boy&#8221; Chintz leading his horse
round.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might tell your mother,&#8221; the rancher went on,
&#8220;that I&#8217;ll come to-morrow to read over that fencing
contract she spoke about for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hervey leered round upon him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will it do if I tell Prue instead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not.&#8221; Iredale&#8217;s face was quite expressionless
at that moment. &#8220;You will please do as I
ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hervey gulped down his chagrin; but his eyes
were alight with the anger from which his lips
refrained. He mounted his horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, good-bye, George,&#8221; he said, with a great
display of cordiality. &#8220;I hope those owls of yours
will permit me to ride in peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no doubt they will,&#8221; replied Iredale, with
an inscrutable smile. &#8220;Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hervey rode away. The man he had left remained
standing at his front door. The horseman half
turned in his saddle as the bush closed about him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Curse the man for his d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;d superiority,&#8221; he
muttered. &#8220;I suppose he thinks I am blind. Well,
Mr. Iredale, we&#8217;ve made a pleasant start from my
point of view. If you intend to marry Prudence
you&#8217;ll have to pay the piper. Guess I&#8217;m that piper.
It&#8217;s money I want, and it&#8217;s money you&#8217;ll have to pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mysterious owner of Lonely Ranch was
thinking deeply as he watched his guest depart.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe he&#8217;s the greatest scoundrel I have ever
come across,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;Money? Why,
he&#8217;d sell his soul for it, or I&#8217;m no judge of men of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
his kidney, and, worse luck, I know his sort well
enough. I wonder what made me do it? Not friendship.
Prudence? No, not exactly. And yet&ndash;&ndash;I
don&#8217;t know. I think I&#8217;d sooner have him on my side
than against me.&#8221; Then he turned his eyes towards
the corrals and outbuildings which were dotted about
amongst the trees, and finally they settled upon a
little clearing on the side of Front Hill. It was a
graveyard of the early settlers. &#8220;Yes, I must break
away from it all&ndash;&ndash;and as soon as possible. I have
said so for many a year, but the fascination of it has
held me. If I hope to ever marry Prudence I must
give it up. I must not&ndash;&ndash;dare not let her discover the
truth. The child&#8217;s goodness drives me to desperation.
Yes&ndash;&ndash;it shall all go.&#8221;</p>
<p>His gaze wandered in the direction Hervey had
taken, and a troubled look came into his calm eyes.
A moment later he turned suddenly with a shiver and
passed into the house. Somehow his thoughts were
very gloomy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE GRAVEYARD AT OWL HOOT</h3>
</div>
<p>Prudence and Alice Gordon surveyed the wild
scene that suddenly opened out before them. They
had drawn their horses up to a standstill on the brow
of no inconsiderable hill, and beyond stretched a
panorama of strikingly impressive beauty. Nature in
one of her wildest moments, verdant and profound,
was revealed.</p>
<p>Alice was a pretty girl, rather ordinary, and ever
ready for laughter, which helped to conceal an undercurrent
of serious thought. She was an old pupil of
Sarah Gurridge&#8217;s, and consequently Prudence&#8217;s school-friend.
But Alice lived in Ainsley, where, report had
it, she was &#8220;keeping company&#8221; with Robb Chillingwood,
and now the two girls only met when Alice
visited the farm at such seasons of the year as the
present.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think it will be safe to go further?&#8221; asked
Alice, in a tone of awestruck amazement. &#8220;You say
you are sure of the way. Would it not be better to
turn off here and make for Lonely Ranch, and seek
Chintz&#8217;s guidance? There is time enough, and it is
so easy to get lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls had set out to visit Lonely Ranch, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
enjoy a ramble and a sort of picnic in the surrounding
woods. Iredale was away on business, and the two
friends, availing themselves of the opportunity, were
taking a day off from the duties of the farm. They
had started with the intention of riding over and
leaving their horses with Iredale&#8217;s man, Chintz, and
then proceeding on foot. At the last moment Prudence
had changed her mind and decided on a visit to
the great Lake of the Woods, which was two miles
further on to the south-west of the ranch. They
carried their provisions in their saddle-bags, and had
made up their minds to find some suitable break in
the woods on the shore of the lake where they could
tether their horses and idle the afternoon away.</p>
<p>Instead of turning into the valley of Owl Hoot
they had crossed the mouth of it, and were now at
the summit of its eastern slope, gazing out upon the
mysteries of the almost uninhabited regions beyond.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it&#8217;s safe, you silly,&#8221; said Prudence.
&#8220;Why, suppose we were to lose ourselves, that old
mare you are riding would take you home straight as
the crow flies. Besides, I have no fancy for that ferret-faced
Chintz becoming one of our party. We could
never talk freely in front of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then,&#8221; said Alice, with a sigh. &#8220;You
are leader of this expedition. Don&#8217;t the woods look
gloomy? And look out beyond. There seems to be
no end to them. Shall we stop and have dinner here,
and ride on afterwards?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not, madam,&#8221; Prudence said briskly.
&#8220;No shirking; besides, we want water to make our
tea. There&#8217;s none here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence understood her friend&#8217;s fears, which were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
not without reason. It was a simple thing to get lost
in such a forest. But anyway, as she had said, the
old prairie horses they were riding would carry them
home should they mistake the road. There was
really no danger.</p>
<p>It was a gorgeous day. The sun was shining with
unabated splendour; as yet it wanted an hour to
noon. The brilliant daylight was somehow different
here to what it was on the prairie. The fierce sunlight
poured down upon an unbroken carpet of dull
green, which seemed to have in it a tinge of the blackness
of the heavy tree-trunks which it concealed
beneath. The result was curiously striking. The
brightness of the day was dulled, and the earth seemed
bathed in a peculiar light such as a vault of grey
rain-clouds above it bestows. The girls, gazing into
the valley which yawned at their feet, were looking
into a shadowed hollow of sombre melancholy&ndash;&ndash;unchanging,
unrelieved.</p>
<p>Beyond stretched a vista of hills, growing steadily
greater as the hazy distance was reached. Behind
where they stood was the Owl Hoot valley and
woodlands, equally sombre, until the prairie was
reached.</p>
<p>The moments passed, and they made no effort to
move. They were both lost in thought, and looked
out across the wild woodlands with eyes which beheld
only that which was most profoundly beautiful.
Prudence was enjoying the scene, the redolent air
which rose from the woods below, the solitary grandeur
of the world about her, with all the appreciation of a
prairie-bred girl. Alice merely saw and marvelled at
the picture before her. She was less enthusiastic, less
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
used to such surroundings than her companion. They
affected her differently. She marvelled, she wondered,
but a peculiar nervousness was inspired by what she
beheld. At length Prudence took the initiative. She
lifted her reins and her horse moved forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along, Alice,&#8221; she said. And the two
disappeared down the slope into the giant forest
below.</p>
<p>Once on their way Alice recovered her good spirits
again. Within the forest the world did not seem
so vast, so confusing to the eye. On either hand,
ahead, were to be seen only bare tree-trunks beneath
the ponderous green canopy which shut out the
sunlight from above. The scrunch of the pine-cones
crushing under the hoofs of the horses carried a
welcome sense of companionship to the riders. Alice
found the reality much less fearful than the contemplation
from the heights above. In a few moments
both girls were chattering gaily, all thoughts of
losing themselves, or of other dangers which these
virgin forests might conceal, having passed from their
minds.</p>
<p>Whatever doubts may have assailed Alice they
were soon set at rest, for, in a short time, after
ascending another rather sharp slope, they found
themselves gazing down upon a long, narrow sheet of
water. It was one of the many inlets with which the
shores of the mysterious Lake of the Woods abound.
From where the girls first caught sight of it, it looked
as though the forest had been cleanly rent by the
glistening water which had cut its way into the dense
growth, demolishing every sign of vegetation in its
path, but leaving everything which grew even down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
to its very edge. This inlet widened out between two
hills, and, beyond that, in a dazzling haze, the vast
body of the lake, like a distant view of the sea, was
just visible. It was a perfect picture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it gorgeous?&#8221; said Prudence enthusiastically.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it worth a few miles&#8217; ride to see it? I&#8217;m glad
we didn&#8217;t go and bother that horrid little Chintz. It
would have taken half the pleasure away to have had
his ferrety face with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lovely&ndash;&ndash;lovely,&#8221; exclaimed Alice rapturously.
Her bright eyes were dancing with delight, and her
breath came and went rapidly. &#8220;Just fancy, Prue; I
have lived all these years within reach of this place
and this is the first time I have ever set eyes upon
the lake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her companion laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is not to be wondered at. There are very
few people who ever come this way. Why, I couldn&#8217;t
say, unless it is that the country is bad to travel
through on this side. Mind, although there are few
habitations on the western shore, there are plenty to
the east and south. I never could understand why
George Iredale selected Owl Hoot for the site of his
ranch. Just think how delightful it would be to have
your home built on this hill.&#8221; The girl indicated
their position with her riding-whip. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be
delightful to wake each morning and gaze out upon
such a scene?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfect,&#8221; said Alice, whilst her eyes glanced
mischievously in her friend&#8217;s direction. &#8220;Summer or
winter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Summer, of course, you goose,&#8221; exclaimed Prudence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course; winter would be different, wouldn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
it?&#8221; Alice was laughing, but Prudence was quite
serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; that&#8217;s the worst of all Nature&#8217;s finest handiwork.
There&#8217;s always some drawback to it. Ugh,
winter in this place would be too dreadful to contemplate.
These wilds are only fit for Indians and
coyotes and wolves when the summer is over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s a heavenly spot now,&#8221; said Alice. Suddenly
she raised her whip and pointed. Far down,
out upon the surface of the silvery belt of water, a
tiny speck was slowly moving. At first so distant
was it that it appeared to be stationary, but after a
while it was distinctly to be seen moving. &#8220;What
is it?&#8221; she questioned sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like a boat,&#8221; replied Prudence. &#8220;I wonder
whose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I give it up. Does Mr. Iredale keep a boat?&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Prudence was the elder of the two girls
she was much the simpler. She was essentially of
the prairie. She had no suspicion of the apparently
innocent inquiry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so. I never really heard. No; I
should think that must belong to some Indians or
half-breed fishermen. There are some of those people
about, I believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>She continued to watch the boat for some moments.
The less serious girl beside her allowed her attention
to wander. Prudence saw the boat approach the near
shore. Then it disappeared under the shadow of the
towering pines. An exclamation from Alice drew her
attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look over the other side, Prue; there&#8217;s another
boat. It has just shot out from that great clump of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
undergrowth. Why, there are a dozen people in it.
Look! they are racing along. Where&#8217;s the other
gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It disappeared under this bank. Ah, the other
one is following in its wake. Yes, I should say those
are Indians.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us go on down. We can see better from the
bank. My curiosity is aroused. I didn&#8217;t know there
was so much fishing done here. Mr. Iredale never
speaks of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think Mr. Iredale sees much of the lake.
His land&ndash;&ndash;that is, his grazing&ndash;&ndash;lies to the west of the
house. But he rarely talks about his work. As he
says, so few people care about this wild district that
he does not like to worry folks by reminding them of
its existence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the same,&#8221; replied Alice, &#8220;one of these fine
days some enterprising American will come along
and find out some, at present, unknown wealth in the
place, and then the settlers round the district will
kick themselves. Trust a Canuk for sitting down on
his hundred and sixty acres and never moving beyond
the limits of his fencing. I like this weird place, with
its woods, its hills and valleys, its lake and its
mysterious boats. You should draw George&ndash;&ndash;I mean
Mr. Iredale&ndash;&ndash;out. There must be a deal that is of
interest here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I draw him out?&#8221; asked Prudence
innocently, as the horses ambled down the hill towards
the shore of the lake. &#8220;You ask him. I believe he&#8217;d
like to tell some one all about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thanks, friend Prue,&#8221; said Alice cheerfully.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not what you might call a &#8216;free agent.&#8217; There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
is a young man, to wit, a certain Robb, who might
object. Besides, I have not turned poacher yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What on earth do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence turned a pair of astonished brown eyes
on her companion. Alice didn&#8217;t answer, and the two
looked squarely into each other&#8217;s faces. The elder
girl read the meaning which Alice did not attempt
to conceal, and a warm flush mounted quickly and
suffused her sun-tanned face.</p>
<p>Then followed a long silence, and the crackling of
the pine-cones beneath the horses&#8217; feet alone aroused
the echoes of the woods. Prudence was thinking
deeply. A thoughtful pucker marred the perfect arch
of her brows, and her half-veiled eyes were turned
upon her horse&#8217;s mane.</p>
<p>George Iredale. What of him? He seemed so to
have grown into her life of late that she would now
scarcely recognize Loon Dyke Farm without him.
This sudden reminder made her look back over the
days since her return from &#8220;down East,&#8221; and she
realized that George, since that time, had literally
formed part of her life. He was always in her thoughts
in some way or other. Every one on the farm spoke
of him as if he belonged to it. Hardly a day passed
but what some portion of it was spent by him in her
company. His absence was only when his business
took him elsewhere.</p>
<p>And what was the meaning of it all? What was
he to her that her friend should talk of &#8220;poaching&#8221;
when regarding her own intercourse with this man?
Prudence&#8217;s face grew hotter. The awakening had
come. At that moment she knew that George Iredale
was a good deal to her, and she felt a certain maidenly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
shame at the discovery. He had never uttered a word
of love to her&ndash;&ndash;not one, in all the years she had
known him, and, unbidden, she had given him her
love. In those first moments of realization her heart
was filled with something like dismay which was not
wholly without a feeling of joy. She felt herself
flushing under the thoughts conjured by her friend&#8217;s
implication, and her feelings became worse as Alice
went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Prue, you can&#8217;t hide these things from me.
I have always intended to say something, but you
are such an austere person that I was afraid of getting
a snub. Mr. Iredale is a charming man, and&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash;I
hope when it comes off you&#8217;ll be very, very happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be absurd, Alice.&#8221; Prudence had recovered
herself now.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Prue,&#8221; the girl retorted emphatically, and
imitating the other&#8217;s lofty tone, &#8220;George Iredale just
worships the ground you walk on. One word of
encouragement from you, if you haven&#8217;t already given
it to him, and in a short time you will be the mistress
of Lonely Ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of the sort&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear girl, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know less than you think you do, and I am
not going to listen to any more of your nonsense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence touched her horse&#8217;s flank with her heel
and trotted on ahead of her companion. But in her
heart she knew that what Alice had said was true.</p>
<p>Alice called after her to wait. The trees were so
closely set that she had difficulty in steering clear of
them; but Prudence was obdurate and kept right on.
Nor did she draw rein until the shore of the lake was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
reached, and then only did she do so because of the
impassable tangle of undergrowth which confronted
her. Just as Alice came up with her she started off
again at right angles to the direction they had come,
riding parallel with the bank. Alice, breathless and
laughing, followed in her wake, until at length a break
in the trees showed them a grassy patch which sank
slowly down in a gentle declivity to the water&#8217;s edge.
By the time this was reached Prudence&#8217;s good-humour
was quite restored.</p>
<p>&#8220;A nice dance you&#8217;ve led me,&#8221; expostulated Alice,
as they dismounted and began to off-saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Serves you right for your impertinence,&#8221; Prudence
smiled over at the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the same I&#8217;m right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now keep quiet, or I&#8217;ll ride off again and leave
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you can if you like; this old mare I&#8217;m riding
will take me home straight as the crow flies. What&#8217;s
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Out across the water came a long-drawn cry, so
weird yet so human that the two girls stood still as
statues, their faces blanching under their tan. The
echoes seemed to die hard, growing slowly fainter and
fainter. Alice&#8217;s eyes were widely staring and filled
with an expression of horror. Prudence recovered
herself first. She laughed a little constrainedly,
however.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are in the region of Owl Hoot,&#8221; she said
significantly. &#8220;That was one of the screech-owls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O-oh! I thought it was some one being murdered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall probably hear lots of strange cries;
these regions are renowned for them. You&#8217;ve got the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
kettle on your saddle, Al. Get all the things out
whilst I gather some kindling and make a fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For goodness&#8217; sake don&#8217;t leave me here alone for
long,&#8221; Alice entreated. &#8220;I won&#8217;t mention George&#8217;s
name again, sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Prudence had tethered her horse and set off
on her quest. Alice, left alone, secured her horse
and proceeded to disgorge the contents of her saddle-bags,
and also those on her friend&#8217;s saddle. This done,
she stepped down to the water&#8217;s edge, and, pushing
the reedy vegetation on one side, filled the kettle. As
she rose from her task she looked out down the wide
inlet. The view was an enchanting one. The wooded
banks opposite her rose abruptly from the water,
overshadowing it, and throwing a black reflection
upon its still surface. There was not a breath of air
stirring; the world seemed wondrously still.</p>
<p>Away to the left the water widened out, and was
overhung by a haze of heat. She was about to turn
away when, from out of the distance, there appeared
another long boat. Instantly the girl was all attention.
This boat was not travelling in the same direction
as were those they had first seen, but was making
for the point where the others had appeared. She
had a much better view down here at the bank of
anything moving on the lake than from the higher
land, and she could not help being struck by the fact
that, whoever the occupants of the strange craft, they
were not Indians. One man was standing in the
stern steering the boat by the aid of a long paddle,
and this man was garbed in white-man&#8217;s attire. The
distance she was away from the object of her curiosity
prevented her distinguishing the features of these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
people of the lake; but that which was apparent to
her was the fact that they were not fishermen, nor
was their boat a fishing-boat. It was long, and
built with the narrowness of a rice-lake canoe, and
so low in the water that its gunwale looked to be
within an inch of the glassy surface.</p>
<p>So intent was the girl upon this strange appearance
that she did not notice Prudence&#8217;s return, and as the
strange craft disappeared within the undergrowth of
the opposite shore, she turned with a start at the
sound of her friend&#8217;s voice beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another boat,&#8221; asked Prudence, &#8220;or the one we
saw before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Another.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a silence; then the two turned away and
prepared their dinner.</p>
<p>They pitched their camp in the shade, and the meal
was quickly prepared. The smoke from their fire
helped to keep off the few late summer mosquitoes
that hummed drowsily upon the sultry air. Everything
was wonderfully peaceful and sleepy about
their little encampment. Not a leaf stirred or a
bough creaked; there was the stillness of death over
all. Gradually the silence communicated itself to
the girls, and the pauses in their chatter grew longer
and their eyes more thoughtful. Even their horses
for the most part stood idly by. The green grass
had but a passing attraction for them. They nibbled
at it occasionally, it is true, but with apparently
little appetite. After dinner the two friends spread
their saddle-blankets upon the grass, and stretched
themselves thereon in attitudes of comfort, from
which they could look out across the shining surface
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
of the lake; and soon their talk almost entirely
ceased. Then, for a while, they lay dreaming the time
away in happy waking dreams of the future.</p>
<p>Alice had bridged for a moment the miles which
divided Owl Hoot from Ainsley, and her thoughts
were with her sturdy lover, Robb Chillingwood. She
was contemplating their future together, that future
which would contain for them, if no great ease and
luxury, at least the happiness of a perfect love and
mutual assistance in times of trial. Her practical
mind did not permit her to gaze on visionary times
of prosperity and rises to position, but rather she
considered their present trifling income, and what they
two could do with it. Now and again she sighed, not
with any feeling of discontent, but merely at the
thought of her own inability to augment her future
husband&#8217;s resources. She was in a serious mood,
and pondered long upon these, to her, all-important
things.</p>
<p>Prudence&#8217;s thoughts were of a very different nature,
although she too was dreaming of the man whom
her sudden realization had brought so pronouncedly
into her life. Her round dark face was clouded
with a look of sore perplexity, and at first the
dominant note of her reflections was her blindness
to the real state of her own feelings. Now everything
was clear to her of the manner in which George
Iredale had steadily grown into her daily life, and
how her own friendly liking for him had already
ripened into something warmer. He was so quiet, so
undemonstrative, so good and kind. She saw now
how she had grown accustomed to look for and abide
by his decisions in matters which required more consideration
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
than she could give&ndash;&ndash;matters which were
beyond her. She understood the strong, reliant
nature which underlaid the quiet exterior. And now,
when she came to think of it, in all the days of her
grown womanhood he had ever been near her, seeking
her society always. There was just that brief period
during which Leslie Grey had swayed her heart with
his tempestuous manner, for the rest it was Iredale.
She tried to shut him out; to contemplate his removal
from the round of her daily life. Instantly the picture
of that life lost its brightness and colouring, and her
world appeared to her a very dreary smudge of endless
toil. Yes, Alice had sounded the keynote, and
Prudence&#8217;s heart had responded with the chord in
sympathy. She knew now that she loved George
Iredale.</p>
<p>This realization was not wholly pleasurable, for
with it came a sudden grip of fear at her simple heart.
Her thoughts went back to some eight months before.
And she found herself again looking into the death-chamber
at the Leonville school-house. That scene
had no longer power to move her; at least not
in the way one might have expected. She no
longer loved the dead man; he had passed from her
thoughts as though she had never cared for him.
But a new feeling had sprung up in her heart which
the realization of this indifference had brought.
And this feeling filled her with an utter self-loathing.
She shuddered as she thought of her own heartlessness,
the shallow nature which was hers. She remembered
her feelings at that bedside as she listened to
the dying man&#8217;s last words. Worst of all, she remembered
how, in the paroxysm of her grief, she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
sworn to discover the murderer of Leslie Grey and
see justice administered. Now she asked herself,
What had she done? And the answer came in all its
callous significance&ndash;&ndash;Nothing!</p>
<p>She roused herself; her face was very pale. Her
thoughts framed themselves into unspoken words.</p>
<p>&#8220;If this is the way I have fulfilled my promise to
the dead, if this is the extent and depth of my
love, then I am the most worthless woman on earth.
What surety can I give that my love for George
is a better thing than was my affection for Leslie
Grey?&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat herself up, she looked over at her companion
and noted the drooping eyelids. Her features
were strangely set, and her smooth forehead wore a
disfiguring frown. Then she spoke in a sharp tone
that startled the girl beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alice, do you think it is possible to imagine you
are in love with a man&ndash;&ndash;I mean, that you honestly
believe you love him at the time and really do not?&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice endeavoured to collect her wandering
thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, I suppose so. I&#8217;ve been in love with a
dozen men at one time and another, never longer
than a month with any one of them. I never go to a
dance but what I fall in love with at least two of
my partners, and my undying affection for both just
lasts the evening out. Imagination is strongly
developed in some people&ndash;&ndash;when they&#8217;re young.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, be serious.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice gazed at the other curiously. Then&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out with it, Prue. What is it that&#8217;s troubling you?
Your face is significant of some dire tragedy.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></div>
<p>&#8220;How long have you been engaged to Robb
Chillingwood?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly six months. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ve never thought of any other man?&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice shook her head. For once she was quite
serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t look at another man. Robb hasn&#8217;t
got two cents to his name, but I&#8217;m going to marry
him or&ndash;&ndash;or&ndash;&ndash;die an old maid.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment the expression of Prudence&#8217;s face
relaxed, but a moment later it set itself into more
stern lines than ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alice, you were right in what you said about
George,&#8221; she went on slowly. &#8220;I can hardly believe
it myself yet. Leslie Grey has only been dead eight
months, and yet here I am thinking all day long of
another man. I believe I am utterly heartless&ndash;&ndash;worthless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s just this. I am not worth an honest
man&#8217;s love. I used to think I worshipped the ground
poor Leslie walked on&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m sure I loved him to distraction,&#8221;
the girl went on passionately. &#8220;Very well;
suppose George asked me to marry him and I consented.
In all probability, in the light of what has
gone before, I should be tired of him in a year, and
then&ndash;&ndash;and then&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re talking nonsense now, Prue,&#8221; said Alice.
She was alarmed at the other&#8217;s tone. The beautiful
face of her friend was quite pale, and sharp lines were
drawn about the mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not talking nonsense,&#8221; the other went on in
a tense, bitter tone. &#8220;What I say is true. In less
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
than eight months I have forgotten the dead. I have
done nothing to discover the murderer who robbed
me of a husband and lover. I have simply forgotten&ndash;&ndash;forgotten
him. Put yourself in my place&ndash;&ndash;put
your Robb in Leslie&#8217;s place. What would you have
done?&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice thought seriously before she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should never have rested until I had avenged
his death,&#8221; she said at last, and a hard glitter shone
in her eyes. Then a moment after she smiled. &#8220;But
it is different. I don&#8217;t think you really loved Leslie
Grey. You merely thought you did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That only makes it worse,&#8221; the other retorted.
Prudence&#8217;s face was alight with inflexible resolve.
&#8220;My debt to the dead must be paid. I see it now
in a light in which it has never presented itself to
me before. I must prove myself to myself before&ndash;&ndash;before&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
She broke off, only to resume again with
a fierce and passionate earnestness of which Alice
had never believed her capable. &#8220;I can never marry
George Iredale with Leslie&#8217;s unavenged death upon
my conscience. I could never trust myself. George
may love me now; I believe I love him, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;No,
Alice, I will never marry him until my duty to Leslie
Grey is fulfilled. This shall be my punishment for
my heartless forgetfulness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice surveyed her friend for some seconds without
speaking. Then she burst out into a scathing
protest&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are mad, Prue,&ndash;&ndash;mad, mad, utterly mad.
You would throw away a life&#8217;s happiness for the mere
shadow of what you are pleased to consider a duty.
Worse, you would destroy a man&#8217;s happiness for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
morbid phantasm. What can you do towards avenging
Leslie&#8217;s death? You hold no clue. What the
police have failed to fathom, how can you hope to
unravel? If I were a man, do you know what I&#8217;d do
to you? I&#8217;d take you by the shoulders and shake
you until that foolish head of yours threatened to part
company with your equally foolish body. You
should have thought of these things before, and not
now, when you realize how fond you are of George,
set about wrecking two healthy lives. Oh, Prue, you
are&ndash;&ndash;are&ndash;&ndash;a fool! And I can scarcely keep my
temper with you.&#8221; Alice paused for want of breath
and lack of vocabulary for vituperation. Prudence
was looking out across the water. Her expression
was quite unchanged. With all the warped illogicalness
of the feminine mind she had discovered the
path in which she considered her duty to lie, and
was resolved to follow it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a better clue than you suppose, Alice,&#8221; she
said thoughtfully, &#8220;the clue of his dying words. I
understood his reference to the Winnipeg <i>Free Press</i>.
That must be the means by which the murderer is
discovered. They were not horse-thieves who did him
to death. And I will tell you something else. The
notice in that paper to which he referred&ndash;&ndash;you know&ndash;&ndash;is
even now inserted at certain times. The man or
men who cause that notice to be inserted in the paper
were in some way responsible for his death.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a moment&#8217;s pause. Then Alice spoke
quite calmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, Prue, has George proposed yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; And Alice smiled broadly and turned her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
eyes towards the setting sun. When she spoke again
it was to draw attention to the time. As though by
common consent the matter which had been under
discussion was left in abeyance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is time to be moving,&#8221; the girl said. &#8220;See, the
sun will be down in an hour. Let us have tea and
then we&#8217;ll saddle-up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tea was prepared, and by the time the sun dipped
below the horizon the horses were re-saddled and all
was ready for the return journey. They set out for
home. Alice was in the cheeriest of spirits, but Prudence
was pre-occupied, even moody. That afternoon
spent in the peaceful wilds of the &#8220;back&#8221;
country had left its mark upon her. All her life&ndash;&ndash;her
world&ndash;&ndash;seemed suddenly to have changed. It
was as though this second coming of love to her had
brought with it the banking clouds of an approaching
storm. The two rode Indian fashion through the
woods, and neither spoke for a long time; then, at
last, it was Alice who ventured a protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you leading us to, Prue?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;I am sure this is not the way we came.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence looked round; she seemed as though she
had only just awakened from some unpleasant
dream.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the way?&#8221; she echoed. Then she drew her
horse up sharply. She was alert in an instant. &#8220;I&#8217;m
afraid you&#8217;re right, Al.&#8221; Then in a tone of perplexity,
&#8220;Where are we?&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice stared at her companion with an expression
of dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Prue, you&#8217;ve gone and lost us&ndash;&ndash;and the sun
is already down.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></div>
<p>Prudence gazed about her blankly for a few
moments, realizing only too well how truly her companion
had spoken. She had not the vaguest notion
of the way they had come. The forest was very
dark. The day-long twilight which reigned beneath
the green had darkened with the shadows of approaching
night. There was no opening in view
anywhere; there was nothing but the world of tree-trunks,
and, beneath their horses&#8217; feet, the soft carpet
of rotting vegetation, whilst every moment the gloom
was deepening to darkness&ndash;&ndash;a darkness blacker than
the blackest night.</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; asked Alice, in a tone of
horror. Then: &#8220;Shall we go back?&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence shook her head. Her prairie instincts
were roused now.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; come along; give your mare her head. Our
horses will find the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>They touched the animals sharply, and, in response,
they moved forward unhesitatingly. The old mare
Alice was riding took the lead, and the journey was
continued. The gloom of the forest communicated
something of its depressing influence to the travellers.
There was no longer any attempt at talk. Each was
intent upon ascertaining their whereabouts and watching
the alert movements of the horses&#8217; heads and ears.
The darkness had closed in in the forest with alarming
suddenness, and, in consequence, the progress was
slow; but, in spite of this, the assurance with which
the horses moved on brought confidence to the minds
of the two girls. Prudence was in no way disturbed.
Alice was not quite so calm. For an hour they
threaded their way through the endless maze of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
trees. They had climbed hills and descended into
valleys, but still no break in the dense foliage above.
They had just emerged from one hollow, deeper
and wider than the rest, and were slowly ascending
a steep hill. Prudence was suddenly struck by an
idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alice,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I believe we are heading for the
ranch. The valleys all run north and south hereabouts.
We are travelling westwards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; replied the other decidedly; &#8220;we shall
then be able to get on the right trail for home. This
is jolly miserable. O&ndash;&ndash;oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s exclamation was one of horror. A
screech-owl had just sent its dreadful note in melancholy
waves out upon the still night air. It started low,
almost pianissimo, rose with a hideous crescendo to
fortissimo, and then died away like the wail of a lost
soul. It came from just ahead of them and to the
right. Alice&#8217;s horse shied and danced nervously.
Prudence&#8217;s horse stood stock still. Then, as no
further sound came, they started forward again.</p>
<p>&#8220;My, but those owls are dreadful things,&#8221; said
Alice. &#8220;I believe I nearly fainted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; said Prudence. &#8220;After all they are
only harmless owls.&#8221; Her consolatory words were as
much for the benefit of her own nerves as for those
of her friend.</p>
<p>The brow of the hill was passed and they began to
descend the other side. Suddenly they saw the
twinkling of stars ahead. Alice first caught sight of
the welcome clearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;An opening at last, Prue; now we shall find out
where we are.&#8221; A moment later she turned again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
&#8220;A light,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That must be the ranch. Quick,
come along.&#8221;</p>
<p>The blackness of the wood gave place to the starlit
darkness of the night. They were about to pass
out into the open when suddenly Alice&#8217;s horse came
to a frightened stand. For an instant the mare
swerved, then she reared and turned back whence
she had come. Prudence checked her horse and
looked for what had frightened the other animal.</p>
<p>A sight so weird presented itself that she suddenly
raised one hand to her face and covered her eyes in
nervous terror. Alice had regained the mastery of
her animal and now drew up alongside the other. She
looked, and the sharp catching of her breath told of
what she saw. Suddenly she gripped Prudence&#8217;s arm
and drew the girl&#8217;s hand from before her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep quiet, Prue,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;What is this
place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Owl Hoot graveyard. This is the Haunted
Hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And those?&#8221; Alice was pointing fearfully towards
the clearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Oh, come away, I can&#8217;t stand it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But neither girl made a move to go. Their eyes
were fixed in a gaze of burning fascination upon the
scene before them. Dark, almost black, the surrounding
woods threw up in relief the clearing lit by the
stars. But even so the scene was indistinct and uncertain.
A low broken fence surrounded a small patch
of ground, in the middle of which stood a ruined
log-hut. Round the centre were scattered half-a-dozen
or more tumbled wooden crosses, planted each
in the centre of an elongated mound of earth. Here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
and there a slab of stone marked the grave of some
dead-and-gone resident of Owl Hoot, and a few
shrubs had sprung up as though to further indicate
these obscure monuments. But it was not these
things which had filled the spectators with such
horror. It was the crowd of silent flitting figures
that seemed to come from out of one of the stone-marked
graves, and pass, in regular procession, in
amongst the ruins of the log-hut, and there disappear.
To the girls&#8217; distorted fancy they seemed to be
shrouded human forms. Their faces were hidden by
reason of their heads being bent forward under the
pressure of some strange burden which rested on their
shoulders. Forty of these gruesome phantoms rose
from out of the ground and passed before their wildly-staring
eyes and disappeared amidst the ruins. Not
a sound was made by their swift-treading feet. They
seemed to float over the ground. Then all became
still again. Nothing moved, nor was there even the
rustle of a leaf upon the boughs above. The stars
twinkled brightly, and the calm of the night was undisturbed.
Alice&#8217;s grip fell from her companion&#8217;s
arm. Her horse reared and plunged, then, taking
the bit between its teeth, it set off down the hill in
the direction of Iredale&#8217;s house. The light which
had burned in one of the windows had suddenly gone
out, and there was nothing now to indicate the way,
but the mare made no mistake. Prudence gave her
horse its head and followed in hot pursuit.</p>
<p>Both animals came to a stand before the door of
the barn behind the house, where, to the girls&#8217; joy,
they found the ferret-faced Chintz apparently awaiting
them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></div>
<p>Alice was almost in a fainting condition, but
Prudence was more self-possessed. She merely told
the little man that they had lost their way, and asked
his assistance to guide them out of the valley to
where the trail to Loon Dyke Farm began. Such was
the unexpected ending of their picnic.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>CANINE VAGARIES</h3>
</div>
<p>The last stage of the girls&#8217; journey&ndash;&ndash;the ride home
from the ranch&ndash;&ndash;was like some horrible nightmare.
It was as though recollection had suddenly turned
itself into a hideous, tangible form which was pursuing
them over the dark expanse of prairie. Even their
horses seemed to share something of their riders&#8217; fears,
for their light springing stride never slackened during
that ten miles&#8217; stretch, and they had to be literally
forced down to a walk to give them the necessary
&#8220;breathing.&#8221; Like their riders, the animals&#8217; one idea
seemed to be to reach the security of the farm with all
possible dispatch.</p>
<p>The farm dogs heralded their approach, and when
the girls slid down from their saddles Hephzibah was
at the threshold waiting for them. The rest of the
evening was spent in recounting their adventures.
Hephzibah listened to their narrative, filled with superstitious
emotion whilst endeavouring to treat the
matter in what she deemed a practical, common-sense
manner. She was profoundly impressed. Hervey
was there, but chose to treat their story with uncompromising
incredulity. So little was he interested,
although he listened to what was said, as to rouse the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
indignation of both girls, and only his sudden departure
to bed saved a stormy ending to the scene.</p>
<p>It was not until the house was locked up, and
Prudence and Alice were preparing to retire&ndash;&ndash;they
shared the same bedroom&ndash;&ndash;that Hephzibah Malling
dropped her mask of common-sense and laid bare the
quaintly superstitious side of her character. The
good farm-wife had not lived on the prairie all her
life without contracting to the full the superstitions
which always come to those whose lives are spent in
such close communion with Nature. She could talk
freely with these two girls when no one else was
present. She had heard a hundred times the legends
pertaining to the obscure valley of Owl Hoot, but
this was the first time that she had heard the account
of these things from eye-witnesses.</p>
<p>She came into the girls&#8217; bedroom arrayed in a red
flannel dressing-gown, which had shrunk considerably
under the stress of many washings, and her night-cap
with its long strings, white as driven snow, enveloped
her head like a miniature sun-bonnet. She came
with an excuse upon her lips, and seated herself in
a rigid rush-bottomed chair. Prudence was brushing
her hair and Alice was already in bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dears,&#8221; she said, as she plumped herself down;
she was addressing them both, but her round eyes
were turned upon Alice, who was sitting up in bed with
her hands clasped about her knees, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking
that maybe we might ask young Mr. Chillingwood
out here. It&#8217;s quite a time since I&#8217;ve seen him. He
used to come frequent-like before&ndash;&ndash;before&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; with a
sharp glance over at her daughter, &#8220;a few months
back. He&#8217;s a good lad, and I thought as he&#8217;d make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
quite a companion for Hervey. An&#8217; it &#8217;ud do &#8217;em a
deal of good to air them spare rooms. I&#8217;m sure
they&#8217;re smelling quite musty. What say?&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice blushed and Hephzibah&#8217;s old eyes twinkled
with pleasure. Prudence answered at once&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good idea, mother, I&#8217;ll write to him at
once for you.&#8221; Then she turned her smiling face
upon the old lady and shook a forefinger at her.
&#8220;You&#8217;re an arch-plotter, lady mother. Look at Alice&#8217;s
face. That&#8217;s not sunburn, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it isn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;maybe it isn&#8217;t,&#8221; replied Mrs.
Malling, with a comfortable chuckle, whilst her fat
face was turned up towards a gorgeous wool-worked
text which hung directly over the head of the bed,
&#8220;though I&#8217;ll not say but what a day in the sun
like she&#8217;s just had mightn&#8217;t have redded the skin
some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very sun-burnt,&#8221; said Alice consciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, we&#8217;ve been in the forest, where there&#8217;s no
sun, nearly all day,&#8221; exclaimed Prudence quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, them forests&ndash;&ndash;them forests,&#8221; observed Hephzibah,
in a pensive tone of reflection. &#8220;Folks says
strange things about them forests.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; put in Alice, glad to turn attention from
herself, &#8220;usually folks talk a lot of nonsense when
they attribute supernatural things to certain places.
But for once they&#8217;re right, mother Hephzy; I shall
never disbelieve in ghosts again. Oh, the horror of
it&ndash;&ndash;it was awful,&#8221; and the girl gave a shudder of
genuine horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;And could you see through &#8217;em?&#8221; asked the old
lady, in a tone of suppressed excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, mother,&#8221; chimed in Prudence, leaving the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
dressing-table and seating herself on the patchwork
coverlet of the bed. &#8220;They seemed quite&ndash;&ndash;solid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they wore long robes,&#8221; said Alice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they now?&#8221; said Mrs. Malling, wagging her
head meaningly. &#8220;But the lore has it that spectres is
flimsy things as ye can see through&ndash;&ndash;like the steam
from under the lid of a stewpan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&ndash;&ndash;es,&#8221; said Alice thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;All I can say is, that I wonder George Iredale
can live beside that graveyard. I tell you, mother,
there&#8217;s no arguing away what we saw. They came
up out of one of those graves and marched in a
procession into the ruined dead-house,&#8221; said Prudence
seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;And my mare nearly threw me in her fright.&#8221;
Alice&#8217;s face had paled at the recollection.</p>
<p>Hephzibah nodded complacently. She was thoroughly
enjoying herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;True&ndash;&ndash;true. That&#8217;s just how &#8217;tis. Animals has
an instinct that ain&#8217;t like to human. They sees more.
Now maybe your horses just stood of a tremble,
bimeby like? That&#8217;s how it mostly takes &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under any other circumstances the two girls would
probably have laughed at the good lady&#8217;s appreciation
of the supposed facts. But their adventures were of
too recent a date; besides, they believed themselves.
The gloom of the forest seemed to have got into
their bones, and the horrid picture was still with
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Haunted Hill,&#8221; said Prudence musingly. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t think I ever heard in what way the valley was
haunted. Have you, mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sakes alive, girl, yes. It&#8217;s the way you have said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
with fantastic fixin&#8217;s added accordin&#8217; to taste. That&#8217;s
how it come I never believed. Folks disagreed about
the spooks. They all allowed as the place was
haunted, but their notions wasn&#8217;t just alike. Your
poor father, child, was a man o&#8217; sense, an&#8217; he argued
as plain as a tie-post. He said there was fabrications
around that valley &#8217;cause of the variating yarns, and
I wouldn&#8217;t gainsay him. But, as Sarah says, when
the washing don&#8217;t dry white there&#8217;s mostly a prairie
fire somewheres around. Your father was that set on
his point that he wouldn&#8217;t never go an&#8217; see for himself,
although, I do say, I urged him to it for the sake of
truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence yawned significantly and Alice had
snuggled down on to her pillow. The former
clambered in beneath the clothes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, mother, all I can say is, that never again,
unless I am forced to, will I visit Owl Hoot. And
under any circumstances I will never run the risk of
getting benighted there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; said the farm-wife, rising heavily to
her feet and preparing to depart, &#8220;maybe George
would like to hear about the thing you&#8217;ve seen when
he comes back.&#8221; She paused on her way to the
door, and turned an earnest face upon the two
girls. &#8220;Say, children, you didn&#8217;t see no blue lights,
did ye?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, mother Hephzy,&#8221; said Alice sleepily. &#8220;There
were no blue lights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; in a tone of relief. &#8220;There&#8217;s no gainsaying
the blue lights. They&#8217;re bad. It means death,
children, death, does the blue light&ndash;&ndash;sure.&#8221; And the
good lady passed out of the room with the shuffling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
gait which a pair of loose, heelless slippers contrived
to give her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prue,&#8221; said Alice, when the door had closed,
&#8220;when are you going to ask Robb to come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as possible, if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks. Good-night, dear; mother Hephzy is a
sweet old thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two girls turned over, and in a few moments
were sleeping soundly. It would have taken more
than the recollections of their adventures to banish
sleep from their tired eyes. They slept the sweet
refreshing sleep of those who have passed their
waking hours in the strong, bracing air of the prairie.</p>
<p>Two days later Hervey was abroad early. He
was cleaning his guns outside the back door of the
house. Two weapons were lying upon a large dust
sheet which was spread out upon the ground. The
guns were in pieces, and each portion had been carefully
oiled and wiped. He was now devoting his
attention to a heavy revolver.</p>
<p>Prudence was standing in the kitchen doorway
watching her brother. Andy was over by the barn
superintending the dispatch of the teams to the
harvest fields; the hands were preparing to depart
to their work. Prudence&#8217;s early morning work was
in the creamery.</p>
<p>Hervey looked up from the weapon he was cleaning,
and turned his great eyes upon his sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;When is this fellow coming out here?&#8221; he asked
in a tone of irritation. His question was merely the
result of his own train of thought. He had not been
speaking of any one in particular.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who? Robb Chillingwood?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course. I&#8217;ve not heard of any one else&#8217;s
coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve asked him for a fortnight to-day. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hervey ran the cleaning-rod through a couple of
the chambers of the pistol before he spoke again.
The rag jammed in the barrel and entailed a hard
pull to extract it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who asked him to come?&#8221; he went on, as he
re-adjusted the piece of rag in the eye of the rod.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother did. He&#8217;s a very nice fellow.&#8221; Prudence
looked over at the parade of &#8220;Shire&#8221; teams as they
started for the fields. &#8220;Alice and he are engaged to
be married, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I suppose he&#8217;s coming out here to &#8216;spoon&#8217;
her&ndash;&ndash;ugh! It&#8217;s sickening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so brutal,&#8221; the girl replied sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brutal?&#8221; Hervey laughed coarsely. &#8220;You&#8217;re
getting particular. The house won&#8217;t be a fit place
to live in with an engaged couple in it. I should
have thought mother would have known better than
to have asked him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be absurd.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence moved from her stand. The dog, Neche,
had slowly emerged from round the corner of the
barn, and was now mouching leisurely towards her.
She went over to meet him and caress his great ugly
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not absurd.&#8221; Hervey followed her movements
with no very friendly gaze. He hated with
an unreasonable hatred to see her go near the dog.
&#8220;I know what engaged couples are. Look at the
way some of the clowns around here carry on with
their girls. When Mr. Robb Chillingwood takes up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
his abode here, I shall depart, I tell you straight.
I think mother should have consulted me first. But,
there, I suppose that little vixen Alice arranged it
all. I hate that chum of yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing like mutual regard, whatever
its quality,&#8221; laughed Prudence; but there was a look
of anger in her deep brown eyes. &#8220;You are at
liberty to please yourself as to your goings or
comings&ndash;&ndash;they make no difference to the work of
the farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s face was turned defiantly upon her
brother. Hervey spun the chambers of the pistol
round. His eyes remained upon the weapon, and
his forefinger pressed sharply upon the trigger. He
looked thoughtfully over the fore-sight and rested
the pistol in the crook of his upraised, bent left arm.
His attitude was one of taking steady aim. He
made no reply.</p>
<p>Suddenly Prudence felt the bristling of Neche&#8217;s
mane under her hand. And she sought to soothe
him. This dog&#8217;s displays of sudden temper were
as unaccountable as they were fierce.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do to-day?&#8221; she asked,
as her brother did not speak and the dog quietened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going over to Iredale&#8217;s place. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When shall you return?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know.&#8221; Hervey turned; his pistol was
pointing towards his sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what about the &#8216;thresher&#8217;? You and Andy
were going to get it&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Look out!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her exclamation came with a shriek. The great
husky had dashed from her side and made a charge
towards its master. Its lips were drawn up, and its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
fearful, bared fangs gleamed in the morning light.
Hervey lowered his weapon with a laugh. The dog
paused irresolute, then, with a wicked growl, it
turned back and sought again the girl&#8217;s caressing
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of these days I&#8217;ll give you something to
snarl at, you d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;d cur,&#8221; Hervey said, between his
clenched teeth. Then he turned at the sound of his
mother&#8217;s voice. The old lady was standing in the
kitchen doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all the fuss about?&#8221; she asked, turning
her round eyes from one to the other. &#8220;Quarrelling
again, I&#8217;ll be bound. Breakfast&#8217;s ready, so just come
in, both of you, or the &#8216;slap-jacks&#8217; &#8217;ll all be spoiled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence glanced covertly in the dog&#8217;s direction
as she obeyed the summons. She was fearful that
the brute contemplated a further attack upon its
master. In spite of the constant bickerings which
took place between these two, the girl had no desire
that her brother should be hurt.</p>
<p>Hervey spoke not a word during the morning
meal, except to demand the food he required, and
his surliness had a damping effect on those about
him, and it was with a sigh of relief that his mother
at last rose from the table and began to gather the
plates preparatory to clearing away. Once, as Hervey
moved slowly towards the door to return to his guns,
she looked as though she were going to speak. But
the words died on her lips, and she ambled off to the
wash-house without speaking.</p>
<p>The atmosphere cleared when Hervey mounted
his horse and rode off. His mother looked after
him, sighed and shrugged; then she went on with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
her work with a touch of her old cheerful manner
about her. No complaint ever passed her lips, but,
to those who knew the kindly old face, the change
that had come over it was very apparent. The
smooth forehead was ploughed deeply with wrinkles
which were new to it, and the eyes had lost something
of their expression of placid content.</p>
<p>But Hervey travelled his own road at his own
gait. His thoughts he kept to himself. The man
was more or less inscrutable to those about him.</p>
<p>To-day he had taken his dog with him. He had
at length made up his mind to rid himself of the
brute. The exhibition of that morning had decided
him upon a course which he had long meditated, but
had always failed to carry out when the critical
moment arrived.</p>
<p>The hound limped along beside its master&#8217;s horse
as they plunged into the deep woods of the Owl
Hoot Valley. Nor did he show the least sign of
wishing to wander from &#8220;heel.&#8221; He followed on
the beaten track, stubbornly keeping pace with
the horse in spite of the fact of only possessing
three legs.</p>
<p>Arrived at the ranch Hervey handed over his
horse to Chintz and proceeded into the woods on
foot. To-day he meant to move out in a new
direction. The valley beyond the Haunted Hill
had been done regularly by him; now he was intent
upon the hills on the south. Access to this region
was obtained by the one other practicable exit from
the valley; namely, the Haunted Hill, and then by
bearing away to the right. He breasted the steep
slopes of the hill and soon came upon the narrow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
overgrown trail which at some period had been hewn
by the early settlers of the district.</p>
<p>Here he tramped along steadily, the hound limping
at his heels. He walked slowly, with that long, lazy
gait of a man accustomed to walking great distances.
He gave little heed to his surroundings as far as the
beauties of the place were concerned. He was not
the man to regard Nature&#8217;s handiwork in the light
of artistic effects. His great roving eyes were never
still; they moved swiftly from side to side, eagerly
watching for the indication of game either furred or
feathered. It seemed as though this sport was as
the breath of life to him. Now and again his gaze
would turn upon the hound behind him, and, on
these occasions, the movement was evidently the
result of some sudden, unpleasant thought, and
had nothing to do with the sportsman&#8217;s watchfulness
which makes him seek to discover, in the
alert canine attitude, some keener instinct of the
presence of game than is possessed by the human
being.</p>
<p>Almost without forewarning the road, after rounding
an abrupt bend, suddenly opened out on to the
graveyard clearing. It was the first time in Hervey&#8217;s
many wanderings in these regions that he had
actually come across this obscure little cemetery.
For a moment, as he gazed upon it, he hardly
realized what it was. Then, as he noted the ruined
hut in the middle, the wooden fencing broken and
tumbled about the place, and the armless and sadly
leaning crosses and the various-shaped slabs of stone
which marked the graves, he remembered the weird
story his sister and her friend had told, and, advancing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
he leant upon one of the fence posts and looked
about him curiously.</p>
<p>He stood for some moments quite still. The place
was silent with the peaceful calm of a sweltering
August day. Hervey&#8217;s eyes moved from one vaguely
outlined grave to another, and unconsciously he
counted them. Thirteen graves in all were visible
amongst the long grass. Then his eyes turned upon
the ruined hut. The roof had fallen in, and broken
rafters protruded above the still standing walls of
pine logs. The casing of the doorway remained, but
the door had gone, and in its place hung a piece of
tattered sacking. There was one small window, but
this had been boarded over. The building was
largely covered with lichen, and weeds had grown
out of the mud-filling daubed in between the logs.
There was something very desolate but wondrously
peaceful about the place.</p>
<p>The master&#8217;s curiosity seemed to have communicated
itself to the hound, for the animal slowly,
and with uncertain tread, moved off within the enclosure.
Neche&#8217;s movements were furtive; strangely
so. But though Hervey&#8217;s eyes now followed the
dog&#8217;s actions, it was merely the result of the attraction
of the one moving object within the range of his
vision, and not with any purpose of his own. In
fact, it is doubtful if, at first, the animal&#8217;s movements
conveyed any meaning to the watching man. The
moments slipped away and the dog snuffed inquiringly
at the various curious objects its wolfish
eyes beheld.</p>
<p>It stretched out its neck across one grave and
snuffed at the projecting arm of a wooden cross.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
Then it drew back sharply with its little upstanding
ears twitching with a motion of attention and canine
uncertainty. Then the wolf head was turned in the
direction of its master, and its unblinking gaze was
fixed upon his face. The animal stood thus with
ears constantly moving, turning this way and that,
listening for any strange sound that might chance
upon the air. Then with a dignified movement, so
expressive of ill-concealed curiosity, it turned away
to continue investigations in other directions.</p>
<p>The dog&#8217;s show of indifference only lasted for a
moment. In limping towards the central hut the
animal stepped on to the only path which was not
overgrown with rank vegetation. The instant its
foot touched the sandy soil its head went down until
its nose touched the ground. Then followed a loud
snuff. The dog&#8217;s great mane bristled ominously, and
a low growl sounded significantly upon the still air.
Now Hervey&#8217;s gaze instantly became one of keen
intelligence. His thoughts no longer wandered, but
were of the present. He watched the movements of
the hound with the profoundest interest.</p>
<p>The dog moved a step or two forward. Its attitude
was as though it wished to make no mistake.
The snuffing came short, quick and incisive. Then
the great head was raised, and the snuffing continued
upon the air. Now the nose turned in the direction
of the hut, then it turned back to the opposite
direction of the path. Hervey remained motionless
where he stood, and his thoughts were filled with
wondering speculation.</p>
<p>Suddenly the dog darted off down the path, away
from the hut. There was something very like the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
sleuth in its attitude. Nor did it pause until the
path terminated at a stone-covered grave. Here the
brute&#8217;s eagerness was displayed to the full. Its
excitement was intense. The low growls became
more frequent and tense. The bristling mane, so
thick and wolfish, fairly quivered in its rigidity.
Balancing itself on its one hind foot it tore away
at the baked earth around the stone with its huge
fore-paws, as though it would tear up the whole
grave and lay bare the mouldering bones it contained.</p>
<p>Hervey encouraged the eager hound.</p>
<p>&#8220;See&ndash;&ndash;ek &#8217;em,&#8221; he hissed, in an undertone.</p>
<p>The dog responded, making the earth fly beneath
its sharp claws. The animal&#8217;s excitement had communicated
itself to its master, and the man&#8217;s great
eyes glowed strangely. He now moved from his
position and came over to the dog&#8217;s side. He
stooped down and examined the place where the
dog had been working. He pushed his fingers deep
into the hollow which the vigorous claws had made.
The next instant he drew them back sharply, and a
faint ejaculation escaped him. He straightened himself
up and pushed the dog roughly away from the
spot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here, you cur,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Come over
to the hut.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dog obeyed with reluctance, and Hervey had
to keep a clutch upon the beast&#8217;s mane to hold him
to his side. He half dragged him and half led him
up the path until they neared the ruin. Then with a
bound the dog leapt forward and rushed in beneath
the sacking which covered the doorway, giving tongue
to little yelps of eagerness as he went.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></div>
<p>Hervey was about to follow, but a strange sound
beneath his feet attracted him and made him pause.
He listened. The noise went on. It was very faint
but quite distinct, and very like the regular fall of a
hammer. He called instantly to the dog. Neche&#8217;s
head appeared from beneath the canvas, but he
showed unusual signs of disobedience. Instantly,
Hervey seized him by the mane, then, subdued and
sulky, the animal allowed himself to be dragged from
the building. Hervey did not relax his hold until he
and the dog were well clear of the place, and were
once more buried from view within the depths of
the woods.</p>
<p>For a moment, when the hound regained its freedom,
it stood still and turned its head back towards
the place they had just left, but a threatening command
from the man brought him to heel at once, and
there was no further bother. It was strange the relations
which existed between this curiously-assorted
pair. There could be no doubt that Hervey hated
the dog, and the dog&#8217;s regard for its master was of
doubtful quality. As a rule, it would fawn in a most
servile manner, but its attitude, the moment its
master&#8217;s back was turned, was always morose and
even truculent. Hervey had told his sister that the
dog was as treacherous as an Indian. But Hervey
was not a keen observer, or he would have added,
&#8220;and as wicked as a rattlesnake.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two tramped on all that day, but there was
little shooting done. Hervey also seemed to have
utterly forgotten his intention to shoot the dog.
Time after time jack-rabbits got up and dashed off
into the woods, but there followed no report of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
gun. Prairie chicken in the open glades whirred up
from the long succulent grass, but Hervey paid no
heed, and when several deer trotted across the man&#8217;s
path, and the gun remained tucked under his arm, it
plainly showed the pre-occupied state of his mind.</p>
<p>The truth was that Hervey was thinking with a
profundity that implied something which must very
nearly affect his personal interests. And these personal
interests, at the moment, centred round George
Iredale and&ndash;&ndash;the graveyard. He had discredited
the story the girls had told as he would discredit
anything which pertained to the supernatural. But
now he had learned something which put an
entirely different meaning to the adventures the
two girls had related. It is easy enough to mystify
the simple human mind, but dogs&#8217; instincts
are purely practical, and, as Hervey argued, ghosts
do not leave a hot scent. Neche had lit upon a hot
scent. At first the man had been doubtful as to
what that scent was. Graveyards on the prairie are
places favoured by the hungry coyote, and he had
been inclined to believe that such was the trail which
the dog had discovered. But his own investigations
had suggested something different.</p>
<p>The grave which the dog had attacked so furiously
was no ordinary grave, for, in thrusting his hand into
the hole the dog had made at the edge, he had found
that beneath the stone was a cavity. Then had come
the recollection of the faint pounding he had distinctly
heard beneath the ground. And instantly the story
the girls had related assumed a human aspect. Without
hesitation he told himself that they had not seen
spectres marching in procession through the mysterious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
graveyard, but real, live, human beings. What,
he asked himself, was the meaning of it? What
strange occupation was George Iredale&#8217;s in this lonely
valley? Where was Iredale now? Where did he go
to when he moved out of the district on business,
and what was the nature of the business? To
Hervey it was no great step from questions of this
sort to a general answer. And, when he reviewed
the isolation, the secret nightly doings, the unsuitability
of the district to cattle-raising, and the great
wealth of the owner, all made since his sojourn in
the country, it was no difficult task for his thoughts
to suggest some felonious undertaking. But the one
question for which he could find no reasonable reply
was that which asked the nature of the doings which
seemed to go on at night in the shadow of those
dense forests.</p>
<p>He tramped on heedless of the passing time. His
discovery had roused him to a pitch of excitement
which swayed his thoughts in the direction they
would naturally incline. In what manner could he
turn his discovery to account? His sense of proportion
quickly balanced his ideas. He must at all
costs learn the secret of the graveyard, and if it was,
as he believed, some &#8220;crooked&#8221; dealings upon which
Iredale was engaged, the rest would be easy. All he
wanted was money, and the owner of Lonely Ranch
had plenty and to spare.</p>
<p>The sun was quite low over the horizon when he at
length turned his steps again in the direction of the
ranch. He was hungry; he had eaten nothing since
breakfast.</p>
<p>Hervey was not the man to be disturbed by any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
scruples with regard to the hospitality of the owner
of Lonely Ranch. He partook of the ample supper
which Chintz had prepared for him without the
slightest compunction. And when it was finished he
idled the time away smoking one of Iredale&#8217;s best
cigars with the utmost enjoyment. He watched the
shadows grow and deepen. He waited until the blue
vault of the sky had changed its hue to the indescribable
shadow which follows in the wake of the
daylight, and the sparkling diamonds of night shone
out upon its surface; then he called for his horse and
set out ostensibly for Loon Dyke.</p>
<p>He rode away down the valley until he was clear
of the woods; then, leaving the prairie trail, he turned
away to the right, and, describing a wide semi-circle,
doubled back into the woods again, taking a course
which lay to the eastwards, parallel to the valley of
the ranch. Now he quickened his pace, and the
hound, limping laboriously at his horse&#8217;s heels, had
difficulty in keeping up with him. Nor did he draw
rein until he reached the wide hollow which backed
the graveyard hill. Here, however, he dismounted,
and secured his horse to a tree. Then he removed
the reins from his horse&#8217;s bridle, and proceeded to
secure the hound in an adjacent position. The night
had quite closed in and the darkness of the woods
was profound when he started to make his way up
the side of the hill in the direction of the graveyard.</p>
<p>Hervey paused for nothing. His mind was clearly
made up. Whatever weakness may have been his
there was none to be traced in his actions now. He
saw ahead of him the possibilities of furthering his
own interests, and he revelled in the thought of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
George Iredale&#8217;s wealth. The despicable methods
he was adopting troubled him not in the least.
Iredale should pay dearly if his work partook of the
nature of crime.</p>
<p>Hervey entertained no friendship for any one.
The greed of gold was his ruling passion. He cared
nothing from whom it was obtained, or by what
means. If things were as he believed them to be,
then was this a truly golden opportunity. And he
would bleed Iredale to the very limits of his resources.</p>
<p>He reached the outskirts of the clearing, but he
did not leave the obscurity of the forest. The black
recesses served him for a hiding-place from which he
could obtain a perfect view of the ghostly enclosure.
The tumbled hut and the weirdly-outlined graves
with their crowning monuments showed up distinctly
in the starlight. And he settled himself for a long vigil.</p>
<p>An hour passed without result. It was weary
work, this waiting. He dared not move about, for at
every movement of his feet upon the ground the
rotting vegetation crunched and crackled loudly in
the profundity of silence. The man&#8217;s patience, however,
was long-enduring under such circumstances.
He told himself that the result would more than
recompense him for the trouble. He had everything
to gain, and the task appealed to him. Two hours
passed and still not a sound broke the awful stillness.
Then came the first sign. Suddenly a bright light
shone out down in the valley in the direction where
Iredale&#8217;s house stood. It gleamed luridly, almost
red, in its depth of yellow. Hervey held his breath,
so deep was his excitement and the feeling of anticipation.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></div>
<p>The sudden appearance of the light was the signal
for further demonstration. The prolonged screech of
an owl replied to it. The screech, so shrill and ear-piercing,
gave the watcher such a nerve-racking
moment as to almost urge him to beat a hasty retreat.
But the cry died away, and, as the echoes grew fainter
and eventually became silent, he recovered himself.
A moment passed and another cry split the air, only
this time it came from across the valley on the
opposite heights. Hervey stood with ears straining.
He had detected something curious in the sound of
those cries. Then as the second died away a single
word muttered below his breath voiced his discovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Human!&#8221; he said to himself, and a feeling of
unholy joy swept over him, and he drew a pistol from
his pocket and his hand gripped its butt significantly.</p>
<p>His eyes were still turned in the direction of the
house where the light was burning when a scraping
noise suddenly drew his attention to the graveyard
before him. The scraping continued, and sounded
like the grinding of an axe upon a whetstone. It
distinctly came from one of the graves, and, for a
moment, he experienced a shudder of superstitious
fear. The next moment he suppressed a chuckle as
he realized that the sound came from the grave at
the side of which Neche had made such a demonstration
that morning. He gazed in the direction, his
great eyes burning with the lurid fires of pent-up
excitement and speculation. What was the secret he
was about to learn? He longed to draw closer to the
spot, but he knew that he dared not move.</p>
<p>Suddenly a vague shadow loomed up from
amongst the grass which grew so rankly in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
cemetery. Up, up it rose, black even against the
background of utter darkness in which the forest was
bathed. Hervey leaned forward, his eyes straining
and every nerve tense-drawn. What was this&ndash;&ndash;thing?</p>
<p>The shadow paused. Then it rose higher. It
seemed to suddenly straighten up, and Hervey permitted
a deep breath to escape him. The black
figure had assumed the shape of a man, and the
form moved forward towards the log dead-house.
Then the waiting man saw that other figures were
following the first in rapid succession. Each figure
was bearing its burden. Some seemed to be carrying
bundles, some carried that which appeared to be
boxes, and others carried small square packages.
As Hervey&#8217;s eyes became used to the strange scene
he was able to distinguish something of the habiliments
of these denizens of the grave. He noted the
long, dark, smock-shaped garment each figure wore,
and, after a while, in the starlight, he was able to note
that most of them wore on their heads little skull-caps.
Then a muttered exclamation broke from his lips,
and in his tone was a world of satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chinese!&#8221; he whispered. Then: &#8220;Traffic in
yellow, by all that&#8217;s holy!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE BREAKING OF THE STORM</h3>
</div>
<p>The master of Lonely Ranch was seated before
the table in his unpretentious sitting-room. Before
him were piled a number of open account-books, and
books containing matters relating to the business of
his ranch.</p>
<p>He was not looking at them now, but sat gazing
at the blank wall in front of him with thoughtful,
introspective eyes. His chin was resting upon his
clenched hands, and his elbows were propped upon
the table. He was sitting with his shirt-sleeves
rolled up above his elbows, for the day was hot and
the air was close and heavy. On one hand the
window was wide open, but no jarring sounds came
in to disturb the thinker. The door on the other
side was also open wide. George Iredale showed
no desire for secrecy. His attitude was that of a
man who feels himself to be perfectly safe-guarded
against any sort of surprise. Thus he sat in the
quiet of the oppressive heat thinking of many things
which chiefly concerned his life in the valley of Owl
Hoot.</p>
<p>He had been going over the accounts which
represented his fifteen years of labour in that quiet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
corner of the great Dominion, and the perusal had
given him a world of satisfaction. Fifteen years ago
he had first settled in the valley. He had acquired
the land for a mere song; for no one would look
at the region of Owl Hoot as a district suitable
either for stock-raising or for the cultivation of
grain. But he had seen possibilities in the place&ndash;&ndash;possibilities
which had since been realized even
beyond his expectations. His sense of humour was
tickled as he thought of the cattle he had first
brought to the ranch&ndash;&ndash;a herd of old cows which he
had picked up cheap somewhere out West at the
foot of the Rockies. He almost laughed aloud as
he thought of the way in which he had fostered and
added to the weird, stupid legends of the place,
and how he had never failed to urge the undesirability
of his neighbourhood for any sort of agriculture.
And thus for fifteen years he had kept
the surrounding country clear of inquisitive settlers.
Life had been very pleasant, quiet, monotonous, and
profitable for him, and, as he thought of it all, his
eyes drooped again to his books before him, and
he gazed upon a sea of entries in a long, thick,
narrow volume which bore on the cover the legend&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='center'>OPIUM.</p>
<p>Yes, he never attempted to disguise from himself
the nature of his calling. He plastered neither
himself nor his trade with thick coatings of whitewash.
He knew what he was, and faced the offensive
title with perfect equanimity. He was a smuggler,
probably the largest operator in the illicit traffic of
opium smuggling, and the most successful importer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
of Chinese along the whole extent of the American
border. He knew that the penitentiary was yearning
for him; and he knew that every moment of
his life was shadowed by the threat of penal servitude.
And in the meantime he was storing up his wealth,
not in driblets, dependent upon the seasons for their
extent, but in huge sums which were proportionate
to the risks he was prepared to run.</p>
<p>And his risks had been many, and his escapes
narrow and frequent. But he had hitherto evaded
the law, and now the time had come when he
intended to throw it all up&ndash;&ndash;to blot out at one
sweep the traces of those fifteen prosperous years,
and settle down to enjoy the proceeds of his toil.</p>
<p>It was only after much thought and after months
of deliberation that he had arrived at this decision.
For this man revelled in his calling with an enthusiasm
which was worthy of an honest object.
He was not a man whose natural inclinations leant
towards law-breaking; far from it. Outside of his
trade he lived a cleaner life than many a so-called
law-abiding citizen. The risks he ran, the excitement
of contraband trade had a fatal fascination
which was as the breath of life to him; a fascination
which, with all his strength of mind in every other
direction, he was as powerless to resist as were the
consumers powerless to resist the fascinations of the
drug he purveyed.</p>
<p>But now he stood face to face with a contingency
he had never taken into his considerations. He had
fallen a victim to man&#8217;s passion for a woman; and
he had been forced to a choice between the two
things. Either he must renounce all thoughts of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
Prudence Malling, or he must marry her, and break from
all his old associations. To a man of Iredale&#8217;s disposition
the two things were quite incompatible. The
steady growth of his love for this girl, a love which
absorbed all that was best in his deep, strong nature,
had weighed heavily in the balance; and, reluctant
though the master of Lonely Ranch was to sever
himself from the traffic which had afforded him so
much wealth, and so many years of real, living
moments, his decision had been taken with calm
deliberation; the fiat had gone forth. Henceforth
the traffic in yellow would know him no more.</p>
<p>He rose from his seat, and crossing the room
stood gazing out of the open window. Finally his
eyes were turned up towards the heavy banking of
storm-clouds which hovered low over the valley.</p>
<p>Already the greater portion of his plans had been
carefully laid. They had been costly for many
reasons. His agents were men who required to be
dealt with liberally. However, everything had been
satisfactorily settled. Now only remained the disposal
of the ranch. This was rather a delicate matter for
obvious reasons. He wished to effectually obliterate
all traces of the traffic he had carried on there.</p>
<p>He went back to the table and picked up an
official-looking letter. It was a communication from
Robb Chillingwood, written on the municipal notepaper
of Ainsley.</p>
<p>He read the letter carefully through.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>My dear Mr. Iredale</span>,&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a man named Gordon Duffield
stopping at the hotel here, who has lately arrived
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
from Scotland. I have effected the sale of the
Dominion Ranch&ndash;&ndash;you know, the German, Grieg&#8217;s,
old place&ndash;&ndash;to him. He is a man of considerable
means, and is going in largely for stock-raising. He
has commissioned me to buy something like five
thousand head of cows and two-year-old steers for
him. His bulls he brought out with him. You will
understand the difficulty I shall have in obtaining
such a bunch of suitable animals; and I thought you
might have some surplus stock that you wish to
dispose of at a reasonable price. You might let me
know by return if such is the case, always bearing
in mind when you make your quotations that the
gentleman hails from old Scotia. There is shortly
to be a great boom in emigration from both the old
country and the States, and I am now combining the
business of land agent with my other duties, and I
find it a paying concern. Let me know about the
cattle at your earliest convenience.</p>
<p class='ralign'>&#8220;Yours truly,<span class='rindent16'>&nbsp;</span><br />
&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Robb Chillingwood.</span>&#8221;<span class='rindent2'>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Iredale smiled as he read the letter over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Comes at an opportune moment,&#8221; he said to
himself. &#8220;Surplus stock, eh? Well, I think I can
offer him all the stock he needs at a price which will
meet with the approval of even a canny Scot. I&#8217;ll
write him at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>He seated himself at his table and wrote a long
letter asking Chillingwood to come out and see him,
and, at the same time, offering to dispose of the stock
of Lonely Ranch. He sealed the letter, and then
returned his account-books to their hiding-place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
behind the bookcase. Then he went to the door
and summoned his head man.</p>
<p>In spite of the habit of years, Iredale was not without
a strong sense of relief as he reviewed the
progress of the disestablishment of the ranch. He
remembered how narrowly he had escaped from
Leslie Grey less than a year ago, and now that he had
begun to burn his boats he was eager to get through
with the process.</p>
<p>The ferret-faced Chintz framed himself in the
doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;My horse!&#8221; demanded his master. &#8220;And, Chintz,
I want you to take this letter to Lakeville and post it
with your own hands. You understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>The little man nodded his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; Iredale paused thoughtfully. &#8220;Chintz,&#8221;
he went on a moment later, &#8220;we&#8217;ve finished with
opium. We retire into private life from now out&ndash;&ndash;you
and I. We are going to leave Owl Hoot. How
does that suit you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The little man cheerfully nodded, and twisted his
face into a squinting grimace intended for a pleasant
smile. Then his eyebrows went up inquiringly.
Iredale took his meaning at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where we are going as yet. But
you&#8217;ll go with me. I want you to remain my &#8216;head
man.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Chintz nodded. There could be no doubt from his
expression that he was devoted to his master.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right. Send my horse round at once. I am
going to Loon Dyke, and shall be back for supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man departed, and the rancher prepared for his
ride.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></div>
<p>When George Iredale set out for Loon Dyke the
valley was shrouded in the gloom of coming storm.
But he knew the peculiarities of the climate too well
to be alarmed. The storm, he judged, would not break
until nearly sundown, and then it would only be short
and sharp. In the meantime he would have reached
the farm. There was a curious, unconscious rapidity
in his way of settling up his affairs. It was as though
some strange power were urging him to haste. This
may have been the result of the man&#8217;s character, for
he was of a strikingly vigorous nature. He had
put the machinery in motion, and now he primed
it with the oil of eager desire to see the work swiftly
carried out.</p>
<p>As his horse galloped over the prairie&ndash;&ndash;he took the
direct route of the crow&#8217;s flight&ndash;&ndash;his thoughts centred
upon the object of his visit. He saw nothing of the
pleasant fields and pastures through which his journey
took him. The threat of coming storm was nothing
to him. For all heed he paid to it the sky might have
been of a tropical blue. The ruffling prairie chicken
rose lazily in their coveys, with their crops well filled
with the gleanings of the harvested wheat fields, but
he scarcely even saw them. All he saw was the sweet,
dark face of the girl to whom he intended to put the
question which women most love to hear; whether it
be put by the man of their choice or by some one for
whom they care not a cent. He had always longed
for this day to come, but, until now, had never seen
how such could ever dawn for him. It had been a
great wrench to sever himself from the past, but his
decision once taken his heart was filled with thankfulness,
and never had he felt so free from care as now.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
He realized all that a lover may realize of his own
unworthiness, but he allowed himself no extravagances
of thought in this direction. Prudence was a good
woman, he knew, and he intended, if Fate so willed,
to devote the rest of his life to her happiness. As he
drew near to his destination his heart beat a shade
faster, and doubts began to assail him. He found
himself speculating upon his chances of success. He
believed that the daughter of Hephzibah Malling
regarded him with favour, but nothing had gone
before to give him any clue to her maiden feelings.
He wondered doubtfully, and, in proportion, his
nervousness increased.</p>
<p>Out upon the trail, at a distance, he saw a horseman
riding away from the farm; he did not even trouble
about the rider&#8217;s identity. The strong, reckless nature,
concealed beneath his quiet exterior, urged him on to
learn his fate. Nothing mattered to him now but his
sentence as pronounced by the child of the prairie
whose love he sought.</p>
<p>There were three occupants of the sitting-room at
the farm. Prudence and Alice Gordon were at the
table, which was covered by a litter of tweed dress
material and paper patterns. Prudence was struggling
with a maze of skirt-folds, under which a sewing-machine
was almost buried. Alice was cutting and
pinning and basting seams at the other end of the
table. Sarah Gurridge was standing beside the open
window watching the rising of the storm.</p>
<p>Conversation came spasmodically. The girls were
intent upon their work.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all very well to have new dresses,&#8221; said Prudence,
with an impatient tug at the material on which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
the machine was operating, &#8220;but I&#8217;m afraid half the
pleasure of them is absorbed by the process of &#8216;making.&#8217;
Oh, these endless seams! And I don&#8217;t believe a single
one of them is straight. I feel quite hopeless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheer up, Prue,&#8221; said Alice, without looking up.
She herself was endeavouring to set a wristband
pattern upon a piece of stuff so that she could get the
two bands out of barely enough cloth for one. &#8220;You
should use more dash when working a machine.
When you are turning it, imagine you are driving a
&#8216;through mail&#8217; to the coast and have to make up
time. The seams will come all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and break cotton and needles, and&ndash;&ndash;and land
the engine over the side of a cut-bank, or run down a
gang of plate-layers or something. There now, I&#8217;ve
run clean off the cloth. I wish you wouldn&#8217;t talk so
much.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two girls laughed whilst they joined efforts in
righting the catastrophe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it getting dark?&#8221; said Alice, when Prudence
had once more settled to work.</p>
<p>Sarah spoke without turning from the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;The storm&#8217;s banking, child. The lightning is
already flashing over Owl Hoot way. Hervey will
only just escape it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he want to go over to the ranch for?&#8221;
asked Prudence. &#8220;He never seems to go anywhere
else now. I should think Mr. Iredale will get sick of
having him always round.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; observed Sarah, with unction, &#8220;when
two men enjoy destroying the harmless life which the
good God has set upon the prairie, they never tire of
one another&#8217;s society. Men who would disdain to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
black a pair of boots would not hesitate to crawl
about in the mud and damp reeds of a swamp at daybreak
to slaughter a few innocent ducks. There is
a bond amongst sportsmen which is stronger than all
the vows made at any altar. Hervey&#8217;s delight in
destroying life is almost inhuman. I trust he never
shoots sitting game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should hope not,&#8221; said Prudence. &#8220;I would
never own him as a brother if he did. Hello, Neche,&#8221;
as the door was pushed slowly open and the great
husky limped heavily into the room. The animal
looked round him in a dignified, unblinking way, and
then came over to Prudence&#8217;s side and leisurely curled
himself up on the skirt of her dress. &#8220;Say, old boy,&#8221;
she added, looking down at the recumbent form, &#8220;if
mother comes in and finds you here you&#8217;ll leave the
room hurriedly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice laid her scissors down and looked over at
her friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hervey seems quieter than ever lately. He won&#8217;t
even take the trouble to quarrel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And a good thing too,&#8221; said Prudence shortly.</p>
<p>Sarah turned and surveyed the two girls for a
moment, an amused expression was in her dreamy
eyes. Then she turned back to the window as the
first distant growl of the coming storm made itself
heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hervey only quarrels when his mind is in a state
of stagnation. The mind of a man is very like a
pool of water. Let it stand, and it corrodes with
matter which throws off offensive odours. The
longer it stands the worse state it gets into. Set
the water in motion, turn it into a running stream,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
and it at once cleanses itself. Hervey&#8217;s mind has
been lately set in motion. I have noticed the change.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has certainly become less offensive of late,&#8221;
said Alice. &#8220;I wonder what has changed him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Food for mental occupation,&#8221; said Sarah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;A life monotonous, unrelieved, breeds selfish discontent,
Dead&#8217;ning a mind to lofty thought for which by nature meant.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prudence brought the machine to a standstill, and
propping one elbow upon the table rested her chin
upon her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you are right, Aunt Sarah,&#8221; she said
slowly. &#8220;Hervey&#8217;s certainly found something which
has set him thinking. I rather fancy I know&ndash;&ndash;or
can guess&ndash;&ndash;what it is that has roused him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old lady turned from the window and gazed
curiously at her pupil. She was keenly interested.
The recreation of her life was the observation of her
kind. Her logic and philosophy may not always
have been sound, but she never failed to arrive somewhere
in the region of the truth. The recent change
in Hervey had puzzled her.</p>
<p>&#8220;He asked me yesterday to let him see that notice
in the <i>Free Press</i> which appeared when Leslie was
murdered,&#8221; Prudence went on. &#8220;He also asked me
what Leslie&#8217;s dying words were. He insisted on the
exact words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The storm will break soon,&#8221; observed Sarah.
She had turned away to the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Alice; &#8220;perhaps he has discovered&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
She broke off meaningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I think,&#8221; said Prudence.</p>
<p>Sarah shook her head; but what she meant to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
convey was uncertain, for she had her back turned
and she said nothing at the moment. Prudence restarted
her machine and Alice reluctantly bent over
her patterns. Sarah moved back from the window.
She saw a horseman galloping over the prairie in the
direction of the house. She had recognized Iredale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls,&#8221; she said, her soft eyes turning on Prudence&#8217;s
bent head, &#8220;I really think some one should be helping
the mother. This is baking day.&#8221; Prudence looked
up with an expression of contrition. &#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;no, not
you, child. You stay here and get on with your
fandangles and dressmaking. I&#8217;ll go and help her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without waiting for a reply she darted off. She
had no intention of having her innocent little scheme
upset. The moment after her departure the clatter
of horse&#8217;s hoofs came in through the open window.
Alice, looking up, saw Iredale dismounting from his
horse. She jumped up to go to the front door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Mr. Iredale!&#8221; she exclaimed. Then: &#8220;So
he&#8217;s returned home. I&#8217;m so glad. One scarcely
knows the place without him.&#8221;</p>
<p>She dashed out to meet him, and, a moment later,
returned ushering him in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. George Iredale,&#8221; she announced, with mock
ceremony. Then she stood aside to allow him to
pass, bowing low as he entered the room. She stood
for a moment smiling upon the burly figure. She
noted how the plain features lit up at the sight of
the girl bending over the sewing-machine. Then she
gave herself an obvious cue.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go and call mother Hephzy,&#8221; she said, and
retreated hastily to the bake-house.</p>
<p>Iredale moved over to where Prudence was sitting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
She had ceased work to greet him, but she did not
rise from the table. Neche surveyed the intruder,
grunted and closed his eyes again. Prudence was
half inclined to resent Alice&#8217;s sudden departure.
Alice was in her confidence; she knew her feelings
as regarded George Iredale. She considered her
friend&#8217;s action was unkind.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t let me disturb you, Prudence,&#8221; Iredale
said in his low, pleasant voice. &#8220;What is this&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;fingering
the material&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;a new fall dress? Wonderful
how you can cope with the intricacies of the manufacture
of such things. It would be a very sorry day
for me if I were left to cut my own coats.&#8221; He
laughed nervously.</p>
<p>Prudence detected an unusual eagerness in his voice,
and something warned her that this man had come
over that afternoon to see her alone. She joined in
the laugh, but her eyes remained quite serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you come back from town?&#8221; she asked,
after a pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been to town. I&#8217;ve been across the
border. My business took me into Minnesota.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I thought you had been to Winnipeg.&#8221; She
stooped and caressed the great dog at her feet.</p>
<p>Iredale shook his head. A vivid flash of lightning
shot across the open window, and a crash of thunder
followed it immediately. The storm was breaking
at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll close the window.&#8221; Iredale moved across the
room to do so. Prudence looked after him. When
he returned he sat himself in Alice&#8217;s chair, having
brought it nearer to the machine. Then followed a
long silence while the machine rattled down a seam.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
The man watched the nimble fingers intently as they
guided the material under the needle. The bent
head prevented him seeing more than the barest
outline of the girl&#8217;s cheek, but he seemed content.
Now that the moment had arrived for him to speak,
he was quite master of himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prudence,&#8221; he began, at last, &#8220;I am giving up
my ranch. I have been making the necessary
arrangements. I have done with money-making.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really.&#8221; The girl looked up sharply, then down
again at her work. She had encountered the steady
gaze of the man&#8217;s earnest eyes. &#8220;Are you going
to&ndash;&ndash;to leave us?&#8221; She was conscious of the lameness
of her question.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite know. That depends largely upon
circumstances. I am certainly about to seek pleasant
places, but I cannot tell yet where those pleasant
places will be found. Perhaps you will help me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; The seam swerved out into a great bow,
and Prudence was forced to go back over it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Easily enough, if you will.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl did not answer, but busied herself with the
manipulation of her machine. Her face had paled,
and her heart was thumping in great pulsations.
Iredale went on. He had assumed his characteristic
composure. What fire burned beneath his calm
exterior, it would have needed the discerning eyes
of Sarah Gurridge to detect, for, beyond the occasional
flashing of his quiet grey eyes, there was little or no
outward sign.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have known you for a good many years, child;
years which have helped to put a few grey hairs on
my head, it is true, but still years which have taught
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
me something which I never dreamed of learning out
here on the prairie. They have taught me that such
a thing as love exists for every man on this earth,
and that somewhere in this world there is a woman
who can inspire him with feelings which make the
pettinesses of his own solitary existence seem very
small indeed. I have learned that man was not
made to live alone, but that a certain woman must
share his life with him, or that life is an utterly worthless
thing. I have learned that there is but one
woman in the world who can help me to the better,
loftier aspirations of man, and that woman is&ndash;&ndash;you,
Prudence.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl had ceased to work, and was staring
straight in front of her out of the window, where the
vivid lightning was now flashing incessantly. As
Iredale pronounced the last words she shook her head
slowly&ndash;&ndash;almost helplessly. The man had leaned
forward in his chair, and his elbows rested on his
parted knees, and his hands were tightly clasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t shake your head, dear,&#8221; he went on, with
persuasive earnestness. &#8220;Hear me out first, and then
you shall give me your decision. I know I am much
older than you, but surely that disparity need not
stand in our way. I dare say I have many more
years of life yet left than lots of younger men. Besides,
I am rich&ndash;&ndash;very rich. With me you can live the life
you choose. If you wish to stay here on the prairie,
why, you shall have the most perfect farm that money
can buy; if, on the other hand, you choose to see the
world, you only have to say the word. Prudence, I
know I am not a very attractive man. I have little
to recommend me, and my life has not always been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
spent as perhaps it should have been; but I love you
very dearly, and my future shall be devoted to your
happiness. Will you be my wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a deafening crash of thunder which
seemed to come from directly overhead. The dog
started up with a growl. Then he stood looking up
into the girl&#8217;s face. The dying reverberations slowly
rolled away and left the room in deathly silence.
The serious light in the girl&#8217;s eyes was augmented by
the decided set of her mouth. She kept her face
studiously turned from Iredale, who, observing with
all the intuition of a man in deadly earnest, read in
her expression something of what his answer was
to be.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you not&ndash;&ndash;do you not care for me sufficiently?&#8221;</p>
<p>The words contained such a world of appeal that
Prudence felt herself forced to turn in his direction.
She now looked squarely into his eyes, nor was there
the faintest suspicion of embarrassment in her manner.
The moment had come when she must choose between
herself and her self-imposed duty. She knew that
she loved Iredale, but&ndash;&ndash;she checked something which
sounded very like a sigh. She had listened to the
precepts of Sarah Gurridge all her life, and, in consequence,
she had learned to regard her duty before
all things. She now conceived she had a great duty
to perform. She felt so helpless&ndash;&ndash;so feeble in the
matter; but the voice of conscience held her to her
mistaken course.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I love you; I am sure I care for you
very, very much, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you will marry me.&#8221; The man reached out
to take her hand, but she drew it back. His eager
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
eyes shone in the stormy darkness in which the room
was bathed.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Leslie Grey was murdered I made a vow
that I would not rest until the murderer was brought
to justice. My vow is unfulfilled. I could not marry
you and be happy while this is so. Do you know
what marriage with you would mean? Simply that
I should make no effort to fulfil my vow to the dead.
I cannot marry you now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale was staggered by the woeful wrong-mindedness
under which he considered she was labouring.
For a moment he could scarcely find words to express
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;but surely, child, you are not going to let
this phantom of duty come between us? Oh, you
can never do such a thing! Besides, we would work
together; we would not leave a stone unturned to
discover the wretch who did him to death&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off. Prudence answered swiftly, and the
set of her face seemed to grow harder as she felt the
difficulty of abiding by her resolve.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is no phantom of duty, George. It is very
much a reality. I cannot marry you&ndash;&ndash;until&ndash;&ndash;until&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale was smiling now. The shock of the girl&#8217;s
strange decision had passed. He saw something of
the motive underlying it. Her sense of duty seemed
to have warped her judgment, and, with quiet firmness,
he meant to set it aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;And this is the only reason for refusing me?&#8221; he
asked. He had become serious again; he seemed
merely to be seeking assurance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Oh, George, can&#8217;t you see how it is?&#8221; She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
gazed appealingly into his face. And the man had
to keep a very tight hold upon his feelings.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid I am a little dense, child,&#8221; he said
gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must make you understand,&#8221; Prudence went
on with nervous haste. Her conscience urged her
forward, whilst her love prompted her to set aside all
recollection of the dead and to bask in the love this
man offered her. She was a simple, womanly soul,
trying with all the strength of her honest purpose to
resist the dictates of her love, and to do that which
seemed right in her own eyes. The task she had set
herself had seemed easy when she had spoken of it to
Alice, but now in the face of this man&#8217;s love, in the
face of her own self-realization, it seemed beyond her
strength. &#8220;Listen to me, and you will see for yourself
that I must not marry you&ndash;&ndash;yet. I believed that
I loved Leslie Grey truly, fondly. As I look back
now I am sure I did. I was never happy but when
I was with him. He seemed so strong and resolute.
I never had a moment in which to doubt myself.
Then, when he died, the agony I suffered was something
too dreadful to contemplate. As he lay on the
little bed with his life slowly ebbing, and I watched
him dying by inches, I was filled with such horror and
despair that I thought surely I should go mad. Then
it dawned on me that he had been murdered, and my
anguish turned to a dreadful feeling of rage and longing
to avenge him. Never in my life did I experience
such terrible passion as at that moment. I believe at
the time I really was mad. The one thought in my
mind was, &#8216;Who&ndash;&ndash;who has done this thing?&#8217; Then
Leslie died, and in his death agony he spoke and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
told me, as well as his poor gasping faculties could
tell me, what had happened. His words were unintelligible
to every one except me. And those words
formed a clue to the assassin&#8217;s identity. By his bedside
I swore to avenge him. Never would I rest until
my oath was carried out. As you know, after that I
became ill and went away. And, oh, the shame of it,
during those months of rest and illness I forgot Leslie
Grey, I forgot my vow. I forgot everything that
claimed my duty. Think of it&ndash;&ndash;the shame, the
shallow heartlessness, the fickle nature which is mine.
I, who had loved him as I believed no girl had ever
loved, had forgotten him as though he had never come
into my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale nodded comprehensively as the girl paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you came into my life,&#8221; Prudence went on.
Her face was turned towards the window now, outside
of which she saw the tongues of lightning playing
across the sky. &#8220;Time went on, and slowly something
crept into my heart which made me realize my shortcomings.
Gradually my conduct was revealed to me
in its true colours, and I saw myself as I really was&ndash;&ndash;a
heartless, worthless creature, so despicable, even to
myself, as to make me shudder when I contemplated
the future. Let me be honest now, at least. I knew
that I loved you, George, that is&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;bitterly&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;as far as
I was capable of love; but what sort of affection was
mine to give to anybody? I could not trust myself&ndash;&ndash;I
despised myself. My conscience cried out.
Leslie&#8217;s unavenged death still remained. My vow
was still unfulfilled. Knowing this, how could I
believe in this new love which had come to me? No,
I could not. And it was then that I saw what I must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
do. Before I could ever dream of love I must redeem
the pledge I made at Leslie&#8217;s deathbed. That alone
could restore my faith in myself. I know that it is
almost impossible to convey to you all that I have
thought upon the matter; but, believe me, I can never
marry while Leslie remains unavenged.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tears stood in the girl&#8217;s eyes as she finished up
her curiously twisted self-accusations. And the
sincerity of her words was not to be doubted for
a moment. Iredale had listened wonderingly, and
he marvelled to himself at the wonders of perspective
in a woman&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you are prepared to undertake the matter&ndash;&ndash;alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother is helping me&ndash;&ndash;it costs money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so. But would not a man&#8217;s help be of
greater importance than your mother&#8217;s? Don&#8217;t you
think that your husband&#8217;s assistance might help you
far more? That it might be able to lighten the
burden of this self-imposed labour. Tut, tut, child.
Because of your vow it should not deter you from
marriage, especially when your husband is not only
ready, but most willing to assist you in clearing
up the mystery, and avenging Leslie Grey. As
regards the quality&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;with a quiet smile&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;of your
regard, well, come, you love me, little girl, on
your own confession, and if you have no graver
scruples than you have offered, then you must&ndash;&ndash;marry
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale leant forward and took the girl&#8217;s two hands
in his. This time she made no resistance. She
allowed them to rest in his broad palms, and, in spite
of all her protests, felt ineffably happy.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></div>
<p>At last she drew them away and shook her head
weakly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it is no good, George. You must not be
burdened with my undertaking. I cannot consent
to such a thing. It is only your generosity and
kindness which make you look at the matter so
lightly. You would regret your decision later on,
and then&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;No, mother and I will see the matter
through. We have already secured the services of
the smartest detective in Winnipeg, and he is working
upon the only clue we possess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I insist,&#8221; said Iredale, with a smile which
made his plain features almost handsome. &#8220;And,
Prue, I am going to tell your mother that you have
engaged yourself to me, and that I am a new recruit,
fortune as well, in the work. No&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; holding up his
hand as the girl was about to protest again&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;no
objections, sweetheart. And, before we go further,
tell me of this clue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence smiled happily. She had done her duty;
she had laid bare her heart to this man. She had
spared herself in no way. She had let him see, she
told herself, the sort of girl she was. He still cared
for her; he still wished to marry her. She bowed
her will to his quiet decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not much to go upon, but, as Deane, that
is the detective, says, it is a decided clue.&#8221;</p>
<p>She rose from her seat and walked over to a small
work-table. At that moment the house shook to its
very foundations with a dreadful crash of thunder.
Neche, who had moved with her, leapt fiercely at the
window as though flying at some invisible enemy.
The girl called him to her side, then she stood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
trembling. Flash after flash of lightning blazed in
the heavens, and she covered her eyes with her hands,
whilst the thunder seemed as though it would rend
the earth from end to end. Iredale was at her side
in an instant, and his arm was about her, and he drew
her head upon his shoulder. Instantly her nerve
was restored, and, as the noise passed, she quietly
released herself. Then, stooping, she opened the
drawer of the table and produced a torn copy of the
Winnipeg <i>Free Press</i>. She held out the paper and
pointed to the personal column.</p>
<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; she said, with her index finger upon the
second line of the column. &#8220;&#8216;Yellow booming&ndash;&ndash;slump
in Grey.&#8217; Those who are responsible for that
message, whatever it may mean, are also responsible
for Leslie&#8217;s death.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale&#8217;s eyes were fixed with a terrible fascination
upon the print. A breath escaped him which sounded
almost like a gasp. His hands clenched at his sides,
and he stood like one turned into stone.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&ndash;&ndash;how do you know this?&#8221; he asked, in a
tense, hoarse voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leslie said so with his last dying breath.&#8221;</p>
<p>There came no answering word to the girl&#8217;s statement.
Iredale did not move. His eyes were still
upon the paper. The silence of death reigned in
the room. Even the storm seemed suddenly to have
ceased; only was there the incessant swish of the
torrential rain outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the clue poor Leslie gave me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must give me time to think.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></div>
<p>Iredale&#8217;s mouth was parched. His voice sounded
strange in his own ears. For the moment he could
scarcely realize his position. An overwhelming
horror was upon him. Suddenly he turned.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the date of that paper?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A few days before Leslie&#8217;s death. But this notice
has appeared many times since&ndash;&ndash;which will make
our task the easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it will make our task the easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another pause, which was protracted until the
silence could almost be felt. Then Prudence spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will stay to tea?&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale pulled himself together.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I think not. The storm has passed, the rain
is ceasing. I had better hurry back home. It will
come back on us&ndash;&ndash;the storm, I mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl looked out of the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think it will. Oh, I forgot to tell you.
Hervey went over to see you this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale&#8217;s eyes turned sharply upon the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, I will go at once. I will call to-morrow
and see Mrs. Malling. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned away and abruptly left the room.
Prudence looked after him. She saw him pass out;
she saw him go out by the front door and hurry
down the little path which bisected the front garden.
She saw him go round to the stables, and he seemed
not to heed the rain which was still falling lightly.
But it was not until she saw him riding away down
the trail that she realized the suddenness of his departure
and the fact that he hadn&#8217;t even attempted to
kiss her.</p>
<p>Iredale&#8217;s horse received little consideration at its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
master&#8217;s hands on that homeward journey. The
animal was ridden almost at racing pace over the
long ten miles of country. And all the way home
the words the girl had spoken were running in his
ears with maddening insistence&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when we find the author of those words we
find his murderer.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had virtually accused him of murder. For he
alone was the author of those words in the paper.
Truly his sins were finding him out.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>BLACKMAIL</h3>
</div>
<p>As Hervey entered the valley of the ranch he
listened for the warning owl cries. To-day, however,
there were none. He smiled to himself as he noted
the fact, for he knew their origin; he knew their
object. He understood that these cries were the
alarm of sentries stationed at certain points to warn
those at the ranch of the approach of strangers. He
knew, too, that they were used as signals for other
things. And he admired the ingenuity of Iredale
in thus turning the natural features of the valley to
his own uses. Rain was beginning to fall in great
drops, and the thunder of the rising storm had already
made itself heard. He urged his horse forward.</p>
<p>Few men can embark on a mission of hazard or
roguery without some feelings of trepidation. And
Hervey was no exception to the rule. He experienced
a feeling of pleasurable excitement and anticipation.
There was sufficient uncertainty in his mission to
make him think hard and review his powers of attack
with great regard for detail. There must be no loophole
of escape for his victim.</p>
<p>On the whole he was well satisfied. But he was
not unprepared for failure. During his acquaintance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
with Iredale he had learned that the master of Lonely
Ranch was not easily trifled with, neither was he the
man to accept a tight situation without making a hot
fight for it. It was just these things which gave
Hervey the gentle qualms of excitement as he
meditated upon the object of his journey. He
thought of the large sums of money he had borrowed
from this man, and the ease with which they had been
obtained. He remembered the kindly ways and
gentle manner of this reserved man, and somehow he
could not get away from the thought of the velvet
glove.</p>
<p>But even as he thought of it he laughed. There
was no getting away from the facts he possessed, and
if it came to anything in the shape of physical
resistance, well, he was not unprepared. There was
a comfortable feeling about the heavy jolt of the six-chambered
&#8220;lawyer&#8221; in his pocket.</p>
<p>The valley seemed much more lonely than usual.
The horrid screeching of the watchful sentries would
almost have been welcome to him. The forest was
so dark and still. Even the falling raindrops and the
deep rolling thunder had no power to give the place
any suggestion of life. There was a mournful tone
over everything that caused the rider to glance about
him furtively, and wish for a gleam of the prairie
sunlight.</p>
<p>At length he drew up at the house. There was
no one about. A few cattle were calmly reposing in
the corrals. There was not even the sharp bark of a
dog to announce his arrival. As Hervey drew up
he looked to see Iredale come to the door, for he
knew the rancher had returned from his wanderings;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
but the front door remained shut, and, although the
window of the sitting-room was wide open, there was
no sign of any occupant within the room. He
dismounted and stood thinking for a moment. Then
he raised his voice and called to Chintz.</p>
<p>His summons was repeated before the man&#8217;s ferret
face appeared round a corner of the building. The
little fellow advanced with no show of alacrity.
Iredale had told him nothing about any expected
visitor. He was not quite sure what to do.</p>
<p>By dint of many questions and replies, which took
the form of nods and shakes of the head on the part
of Chintz, Hervey learnt that Iredale had gone over
to Loon Dyke, but that he would be back to supper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll wait for him,&#8221; he said decidedly. &#8220;You
can take my horse. I&#8217;ll go inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>The head man took the horse reluctantly and
Hervey passed into the house.</p>
<p>For a long time he stood at the open window
watching the storm. How it raged over the valley!
The rain came down in one steady, hissing deluge,
and the hills echoed and re-echoed with the crashing
thunder. The blinding lightning shot athwart the
lowering sky till the nerves of the watcher fairly
jumped at each successive flash. And he realized
what a blessing the deluge of rain was in that world
of resinous timber. What might have been the
consequences had the storm preceded the rain?
Hardened as he was to such things, even Hervey
shuddered to think.</p>
<p>Wild as was the outlook, the waiting man&#8217;s thoughts
were in keeping with his surroundings, for more
relentless they could not well have been. Iredale&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
money-bags should surely be opened for him that
night before he returned home. He would levy a
heavy toll for his silence.</p>
<p>His great dark eyes, so indicative of the unrestrained
nature which was his, burned with deep, cruel fires
as he gazed out upon the scene. There was a
profoundness, a capacity for hellishness in their
expression which scarcely belonged to a sanely-balanced
mind. It was inconceivable that he could
be of the same flesh and blood as his sister, and yet
there was no doubt about it. Perhaps some unusually
sagacious observer would have been less hard to
convince. Hervey was bad, bad all through. Prudence
was good. Swayed by emotion the girl might
have displayed some strange, hidden, unsuspected
passionate depths, as witness her feelings at her dying
lover&#8217;s bedside. Her rage at the moment when she
realized that he had been murdered was indescribable.
The hysterical sweep of passion which had moved her
at that moment had been capable of tragic impulse,
the consequences of which one could hardly have
estimated. But her nature was thoroughly good.
Under some sudden stress of emotion, which for the
moment upset the balance of reason, a faint resemblance
to the brother might be obtained. But
while Hervey&#8217;s motives would be bad, hers would
have for their primary cause a purpose based upon
righteousness. The man needed no incentive to sway
his dispositions. He had let go his hold upon the
saving rock, now he floated willingly upon the tide of
his evil disposition. He preferred the broad road to
Hell to the narrow path of Righteousness. It may
not always have been so.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></div>
<p>The storm abated with the suddenness of its kind.
During Hervey&#8217;s long wait Chintz did not leave him
entirely alone. Several times, on some trivial pretext
the little man visited the sitting-room. And his
object was plainly to keep an eye upon his master&#8217;s
unbidden guest. At last there came a clatter of
galloping hoofs splashing through the underlay of
the forest, and presently Iredale pulled up at the
door.</p>
<p>Hervey watched the rancher dismount. And his
survey was in the nature of taking the man&#8217;s moral
measure. He looked at the familiar features which
he had come to know so well; the easy, confident
movements which usually characterized Iredale; the
steady glance, the quiet undisturbed expression of
his strong face. The watching man saw nothing
unusual in his appearance, nothing to give him any
clue; but Hervey was not a keen observer. Only
the most apparent change would have been seen by
him; the subtler indications of a disturbed mind were
beyond his ken. Iredale seemed to be merely the
Iredale he knew, and as he watched his lips parted
with a sucking sound such as the gourmand might
make in contemplating a succulent dish.</p>
<p>Iredale came in. Hervey met him at the door of
the sitting-room, and his greeting was cordial, even
effusive.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you, George? I knew you were to be
back to-day. Jolly glad you&#8217;ve returned. Quite
missed you, you know. By Jove! what a storm.
Wet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A bit; nothing to speak of. They told me at
the farm you were over here.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></div>
<p>Iredale looked quickly round the room. His survey
was not lost upon his visitor. Then he went on&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chintz looked after you? Had any refreshment?
Whisky?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chintz looked after me! He looked in every now
and then to see what I was doing.&#8221; Hervey laughed
unpleasantly. &#8220;Yes, I can do with a gentle &#8216;four-fingers&#8217;;
thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale produced a decanter and glasses and a
carafe of water. Then he excused himself while he
went to change his clothes. While he was gone
Hervey helped himself to a liberal measure of the
spirit. He felt that it would be beneficial just then.
His host&#8217;s unconcerned manner was a little disconcerting.
The rancher seemed much harder to tackle
when he was present.</p>
<p>Presently Iredale returned, and, seating himself in
a deck-chair, produced a pipe, and pushed his tobacco
jar over to his visitor. He was wondering what
Hervey had come over for. He had no wish for his
company just then. He had hoped to spend this
evening alone. His mind was still in a state of
feverish turmoil. However, he decided that he would
get rid of the man as quickly as the laws of hospitality
would allow.</p>
<p>A silence fell whilst the rancher waited to hear the
object of the visit. The other refused to smoke, but
Iredale lit his pipe and smoked solemnly. His face
was, if possible, more serious than usual. His eyes
he kept half veiled. Hervey cast about in his mind
for the opening of his attack. He seated himself on
the edge of the table and looked out of the window.
He raised his eyes to the leaden sky, then he withdrew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
his gaze and looked upon the floor. He swung one
leg to and fro, as he leant sideways and supported his
attitude with a hand resting upon the table. At
length, as the silence continued, and Iredale presently
raised his eyes and stared straight at him, he
turned to the decanter and helped himself to another
drink. Then he set his glass down with a heavy
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good tack, that,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;By the bye, where
have all your owls departed to? Are they like the
ducks, merely come, pause, and proceed on their
migratory way? Or perhaps&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;with a leer&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;they only
stand on sentry in the valley when&ndash;&ndash;when you require
them to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale permitted the suspicion of a smile. But
there was no geniality in it; on the contrary, it was
the movement of his facial muscles alone. Hervey
had touched upon delicate ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they not welcome you with their wonted
acclamation?&#8221; he asked, removing his pipe from his
lips, and gently pressing the ash down into the bowl
with his finger-tip.</p>
<p>The other grinned significantly. He had plunged,
and now he felt that things were easier. Besides,
the spirit had warmed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a real good game you play, George, old
man. The imitation is excellent. I was deceived
entirely by it. It was only the other night that I
learned that those fearful screech-owls were human.
Most ingenious on your part. You are well served.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale never moved. He smoked quite calmly.
His legs were crossed and the smile still remained
about his mouth. Only his eyes changed their expression,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
but this was lost upon Hervey, for they were
half closed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I quite understand. Will you explain?&#8221;
The rancher spoke very deliberately, his
voice was well modulated but cold.</p>
<p>Hervey laughed boisterously to cover a slight
nervousness. This attitude of Iredale&#8217;s was embarrassing.
He had anticipated something different.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any need of explanation?&#8221; he asked,
when his forced hilarity had abruptly terminated.
&#8220;The only thing which puzzles me is that you&#8217;ve
kept it up so long without being discovered.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a long pause. Then Iredale removed
his pipe from his mouth, knocked it out upon the
heel of his boot, and returned it to his pocket. Then
he rose from his seat and stood squarely before the
other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let us beat about the bush,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
think plain speaking is best&ndash;&ndash;in some cases. Now,
what have you to say?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hervey shrugged his shoulders. His dark eyes
avoided the other&#8217;s gaze; the steely flash in Iredale&#8217;s
grey eyes was hard to confront.</p>
<p>&#8220;A good deal,&#8221; he said, with raucous intonation.
&#8220;The smuggling of Chinese and consequently opium
is a profitable trade. There&#8217;s room for more than one
in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale&#8217;s tone was icy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I am not the man to blow a gaff like
this. There&#8217;s too much money in it, especially when
worked on extensive lines, and when one is possessed
of such an ideal spot as this from which to operate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
That was a positive stroke of genius of yours in
selecting the graveyard as a hiding-place. I suppose
now that place is honeycombed with cellars for the
storage of&ndash;&ndash;of&ndash;&ndash;yellow. Must be, from the number of
&#8216;yellow-devils&#8217; I saw come out of the grave the other
night. My, but you&#8217;re slick, Iredale; slick as paint.
I admire you immensely. Who&#8217;d have thought of
such a thing? I tell you what, you were never intended
for anything but defeating the law, George,
my boy. We could do a lot together. I suppose
you aren&#8217;t looking for a partner?&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale&#8217;s face wore an almost genial expression as
he replied. The rancher&#8217;s tones were so cordial that
Hervey congratulated himself upon the manner in
which he had approached the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, to tell you the truth, I wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;As a matter of fact, you must have seen me despatching
my last cargo of&ndash;&ndash;yellow. Why? Were
you thinking of starting in the business?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That <i>is</i> my intention.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, is.&#8221; Hervey&#8217;s tone was emphatic, and his
attitude truculent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! are you prepared to buy this place?&#8221; Iredale
went on. &#8220;I can easily hand you over my connection.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Buy?&#8221; Hervey thought this man was dense.
&#8220;Why, I haven&#8217;t two cents to my name to buy
anything with. No, I don&#8217;t think there will be any
buying and selling between us, George Iredale.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what do you propose? We may as well
come to a definite arrangement.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rancher&#8217;s tone was peculiar.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll run this thing for all it&#8217;s worth. Hang to
it as long as there&#8217;s a cent to be made.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hervey helped himself to more whisky. His self-satisfaction
was immense. He had not thought that
Iredale would have been so easy to handle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Um. A very nice, comfortable arrangement&ndash;&ndash;for
you.&#8221; Iredale moistened his lips slowly. &#8220;You&#8217;ll sup
the juice while I squeeze the orange for you. No,
friend Hervey, I&#8217;m not dealing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you must!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Must?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; don&#8217;t be a fool. It means more money to
you, and I shall share in the profits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I wanted to make more money I could continue
in the business alone. I am not here to make
money for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale stared straight into the face before him.
His grey eyes seemed to pierce through and through
his companion. Hervey moved from his position.
Iredale&#8217;s attitude was coldly uncompromising.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you refuse my offer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most emphatically.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hervey was inclined to show his teeth. However, he
checked the impulse and spoke in a conciliating tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is another alternative. Your fortune is
very large. I want fifty thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale&#8217;s face relaxed into a genuine smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your demands are too modest,&#8221; he said ironically,
&#8220;Anything else?&#8221;</p>
<p>The other&#8217;s eyes looked dangerous. The lurid
depths were beginning to glow.</p>
<p>&#8220;The money I am going to have before I leave
here to-night.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Ah! blackmail. I thought so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale&#8217;s contempt was biting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Call it what you like, Mr. George Iredale. I tell
you this, you are in my power and you will have to
buy my silence. You like plain speaking; and now
you&#8217;ve got it. Refuse compliance, and I leave here to
expose you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh,&#8221; said Iredale, leisurely turning to the window.
&#8220;Do you think I&#8217;m a babe? How are you going to
prove your charge? Why, you must be the veriest
simpleton to think I am unprepared. By the time
you can bring the law about me there will not remain
a trace of&ndash;&ndash;my work. You can never bring your
charge home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you think not.&#8221; Hervey&#8217;s words sounded like
a snarl. The whisky he had drunk had worked him
to a proper pitch. He had not done yet. His next
shot was to be a long one and a bold one, and he was
not sure where it would hit. He was not sure that it
might not rebound and&ndash;&ndash;but his was the nature
which makes for success or disaster without a second
thought. For him there was no middle course. His
temperament was volcanic and his actions were largely
governed by the passionate nature which was his.
Iredale had not turned from the window, or he would
have seen the evil working of that face. His own
great, broad shoulders were set squarely before
Hervey&#8217;s gaze, and the uncompromising attitude only
added fuel to the latter&#8217;s already superheated feelings.
&#8220;Perhaps you might find it interesting to know that
they are hot upon the trail of the man who shot
Leslie Grey.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale swung round like a flash. Nor were the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
storm-clouds which but now frowned in the heavens
more black than the expression of his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You miserable hound!&#8221; he cried, his eyes sparkling,
and his jaw muscles fairly quivering with the
force of his clenching teeth. &#8220;What hellish crime
would you attempt to fix on me now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hervey grinned with all the ferocity of a tiger.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to fix no crime on you. I merely mention
a fact. Leslie Grey was the only accuser of his
murderer. He stated before he died that the man
who inserted the notice in the paper which ran,
&#8216;Yellow booming&ndash;&ndash;slump in Grey,&#8217; was the man who
murdered him. I suppose you don&#8217;t happen to know
who was responsible for that enigmatical line? You
did not inspire it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The look that accompanied the man&#8217;s words was
fiendish. The great eyes shone with a savage light
They expressed a hatred which no words could
describe. Iredale&#8217;s hands clenched and unclenched.
His fingers seemed as though they were clutching at
something which they longed to tear to atoms, and
his thoughts centred upon the man before him.</p>
<p>Twice that day he had heard this challenge. Once
uttered in all unconsciousness of its significance, but
now with hideous meaning. His powers of self-restraint
were great, but he had reached their limit.
This man had accused him of a dastardly murder.
Suddenly his voice rang out through the room like
the bellow of a maddened bull. His great figure
quivered with the fury of his passion. Hervey had
done his worst; now he shrank before the storm he
had provoked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of my house, you scum!&#8221; Iredale roared.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></div>
<p>&#8220;God! but if you stay here an instant longer, I&#8217;ll
smash you as I would a louse.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rancher stood panting at the door. His flashing
eyes never left the face of the man before him.
Hervey moved; he hesitated. The grin had left his
face and a look of dread had replaced it. Then he
moved on, forgetful of all but his moral and physical
fear of the commanding figure of enraged manhood
that seemed to tower over him. He even forgot the
weapon which lay concealed in his pocket. He slunk
on out of the door amidst a profound silence, out into
the soft twilight of the valley.</p>
<p>The door stood open; the window stood open.
Iredale looked after him. He watched the tall, drooping
figure; then, as Hervey passed from view, Iredale
turned back and flung himself into his chair, and his
laugh sounded through the stillness of the room.</p>
<p>But there was no mirth in that laugh. It was like
the hysterical laugh of a man whose nerves are
strained to breaking tension.</p>
<p>He knew he had made a terrible mistake. His
rage had placed a deadly weapon in his enemy&#8217;s
hands. He had practically admitted his authorship
of the notice in the Winnipeg paper. What would
be the result? he asked himself. Again that strained
laugh sounded through the room.</p>
<p>As Hervey rode away from the valley his fear
of George Iredale fell from him as might a cloak.
His face wore full expression of the evil in his
heart.</p>
<p>He, too, laughed; but his laugh was an expression
of triumph.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re less clever than I thought, George Iredale,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
he muttered. &#8220;You would have done better to have
bought my silence. Now I can sell my discovery
elsewhere. Money I want, and money I mean to
have.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he spurred his horse on as an anxious thought
came to him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>A STAB IN THE DARK</h3>
</div>
<p>Mrs. Malling fumbled her glasses out of her
pocket and adjusted them on her nose. She had
paused in her work to receive her letters, which had
just been brought from Lakeville. The girls stood
by waiting to learn the news.</p>
<p>The summer kitchen was stifling hot. The great
cook-stove, throwing off a fearful heat, helped to
heighten the brilliancy of the farm-wife&#8217;s complexion,
and brought beads of perspiration out upon her
forehead. Prudence and Alice looked cool beside
&#8220;Mother Hephzy,&#8221; but then they were never allowed
to do any work in the kitchen. Mrs. Malling loved
her kitchen better than any part of the house. She
had always reigned supreme there, and as long as she
could work such would always be the case.</p>
<p>Now she was preparing the midday meal for the
threshing gang which was at work in the fields.
Great blocked-tin canteens stood about upon the floor
waiting to receive the hot food which was to be sent
down to the workers. Hephzibah was a woman of
generous instincts where the inner man was concerned.
The wages she paid were always board wages, but no
hired man was ever allowed to work for her and pay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
for his keep. She invariably insisted that every
labourer should be fed from her kitchen, and she took
care that his food was the best she could provide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alice, girl,&#8221; the old lady said, as she tore open the
first letter, &#8220;go and see if Andy is hitching-up yet.
Tell him that the dinner boxes will be ready in
quarter-hour. Maybe you&#8217;ll find him in the bean
patch, I sent him to gather a peck o&#8217; broad beans.
Who&#8217;s this from?&#8221; she went on, turning to the last
page of her letter to look at the signature. &#8220;H&#8217;m&ndash;&ndash;Winnipeg&ndash;&ndash;the
bank. Guess I&#8217;ll read that later.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alice ran off to find Andy, and Mrs. Malling picked
up another envelope.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prudence, my girl,&#8221; went on the farm-wife, as
soon as Alice&#8217;s back was turned, &#8220;just open that
other,&#8221; pointing to a blue envelope. &#8220;The postmark
reads Ainsley. I take it, it&#8217;s from young Robb
Chillingwood. Maybe it&#8217;s to say as he&#8217;ll be along
d&#8217;rectly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence picked the last letter up.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is hot in here, mother; I wonder you can stand
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her mother looked up over her spectacles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand it, child? It&#8217;s a woman&#8217;s place, is the
kitchen. I can&#8217;t trust no one at the stove but myself.
I&#8217;ve done it for over forty summers, an&#8217; I don&#8217;t
reckon to give it up now. This is from that p&#8217;lice
feller. He ain&#8217;t doing much, I&#8217;m thinking. Seems to
me he spends most of his time in making up his bills
of expenses. Howsum, you look into it. What&#8217;s
Master Robb say?&#8221;</p>
<p>She put her glasses back into their broad old-fashioned
case and turned back to the stove. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
could never allow anything to keep her long from her
cooking. She lifted a lid and stabbed her cooking
fork gently into a great boiler full of potatoes. Then
she passed round to the other side and shook up the
fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what a shame, mother! Won&#8217;t Al be disappointed?
Robb can&#8217;t come out here, at least not to
stay.&#8221; Prudence had finished her letter and now
looked disappointedly over at her mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;And how be that?&#8221; asked the old lady, standing
with a shovel of anthracite coal poised in her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;He says that the rush of emigrants to the district
keeps him at work from daylight to dark. It&#8217;s too
bad. Poor old Al!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Malling dumped the coal into the stove with a
clatter and replaced the circular iron top. She said
nothing, and Prudence went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s coming out this way on business shortly, and
will call over here if possible. But he can&#8217;t stay.
Says he&#8217;s making money now, and is writing to Al
and giving her all particulars. I <i>am</i> sorry he can&#8217;t
come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well; maybe it&#8217;s for the best,&#8221; said her
mother, in a consolatory manner. &#8220;Seemingly his
coming would only &#8217;a caused bickerings with Hervey,
and, good-sakes, we get enough of that now. I&#8217;m not
one for underhand dealings, but I&#8217;m thinking it would
be for the best not to say anything to your brother
about his coming at all. If he asks, just say he can&#8217;t
come to stop. I&#8217;d sooner keep Hervey under my eye.
If he goes off, as he said, you never know what mischief
he&#8217;ll be getting up to. He just goes into Winnipeg
and gets around with them scallywags, and&ndash;&ndash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
you never know. I have heard tell&ndash;&ndash;though he never
lets on&ndash;&ndash;as he&#8217;s too fond o&#8217; poker. Leastways, I do
know as he spends more money than is good for him.
Sarah and me was talking only the other day.
Sarah&#8217;s pretty &#8217;cute, and she declares that he&#8217;s got
gaming writ in his lines. Maybe it&#8217;s so. I&#8217;ll not dispute.
He won&#8217;t have no excuse for leaving now.&#8221;
And she sighed heavily and took up the vegetables
from the stove.</p>
<p>Alice returned, and the sound of wheels outside
told the farm-wife that the buckboard was ready for
the men&#8217;s dinner.</p>
<p>The two girls and the old lady portioned out the
food into the great canteens, and Andy lifted them on
to the buckboard. Then the choreman drove away.</p>
<p>By the time the farm dinner was ready Alice had
quite got over her disappointment. Prudence had
told her the contents of the letter, and also her
mother&#8217;s wishes on the subject. Alice was naturally
too cheerful to think much of the matter; besides, she
was glad that Robb&#8217;s business was improving.</p>
<p>Hervey came up from the fields in Andy&#8217;s buckboard.
He always came home for his dinner, and to-day
he brought an atmosphere of unwonted cheerfulness
with him. He had spent much thought and consideration
upon his relations with George Iredale, and
the result of his reflections was displayed in his
manner when he returned from the fields. Never in
his life had he held such a handful of trumps. His
hand needed little playing, and the chances of a cross
ruff looked to him remote.</p>
<p>After the meal he went out to the barn, where he
smoked for awhile in pensive solitude. He thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
long and earnestly, and was so absorbed that he looked
up with a start at the sound of his mother&#8217;s voice
calling to him from the open kitchen window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bestir yourself, Hervey, boy. There&#8217;s work to be
done down in the fields, which is your share in the
day&#8217;s doings.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the man, removing the pipe from his mouth,
forgot to grumble back a rough retort, and answered
quite cheerfully&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, mother. Is Prudence there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where should she be, if not?&#8221; replied his mother,
turning back from the window to tell his sister that
she was wanted.</p>
<p>Prudence came out. Hervey watched her as she
approached. He could not but admit to himself the
prettiness of her trim figure, the quiet sedateness of
her beautiful, gentle face. Gazing intently, he failed
to observe the faint shadow in the expression of her
soft brown eyes. There was no sympathy in his
nature, and without sympathy it would have been impossible
to read the expression. But Prudence was
feeling a little sad and a little hurt. Iredale had not
fulfilled his promise. Two days had passed since he
had told her that he loved her and had asked her to
be his wife; nor, since then, had he been over to the
farm, nor had she heard a word from him.
Fortunately, she told herself, she had said nothing of
what had passed between them, not even to her friend
Alice; thus she was spared the sympathy of her
friends. She had waited for his coming with a world
of eager delight in her heart, and each moment of the
day on which he was to have come to see her mother
had been one of unalloyed happiness to her. Then as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
the evening drew on she became anxious. And again
as night came, and still no sign from him, her anxiety
had given place to alarm. That night she slept little,
but she kept her trouble to herself. Alice was all
eagerness to ask questions of her friend, but Prudence
gave her no opportunity. The next morning a note
had arrived. Business detained him, but he would be
over at the earliest possible moment. And now the
third day was well advanced and he still remained
away. She did not doubt him, but she felt hurt and a
little rebellious at the thought of his allowing himself
to be detained by business. Surely his first duty was
to her. It was not like him, she told herself; and she
felt very unhappy.</p>
<p>Hervey greeted her with an assumption of kindness,
almost of affection.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you busy, Prue? I mean, I want to have a
little talk with you. I&#8217;ve been working in your
interests lately. You may guess in what direction.
And I have made a strange discovery. We haven&#8217;t
hit it off very well, I know, but you must forgive me
my shortcomings. I have lived too long in the wilds
to be a pleasant companion. Can you spare me a few
minutes?&#8221;</p>
<p>The dark eyes of the man were quite gentle in their
expression, and in the girl&#8217;s present state of mind his
apparent kindliness had a strong effect upon her. She
was surprised, but she smiled up into his face with a
world of gratitude. In spite of all, her love for her
brother was very deeply rooted. The simplicity of her
nature and the life she lived made her an easy victim
to his villainous wiles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, Hervey; as long as you like.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Good; I&#8217;m going down to the threshing. Will you
walk some part of the way with me? Mother has just
reminded me that my work must not be neglected.
Another two days and we shall be ready for the fall
ploughing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sun was pouring down with fervid intensity.
The yard was very still and quiet. Everything that
had leisure was resting drowsily in the trifling shade
obtainable. The swine had ceased to make themselves
heard and were sleeping upon each other&#8217;s abdomens.
The fowls were scratching with ruffled feathers in the
sandy hollows of the parched earth, which they had
made during the hours of morning energy. The
pigeons had departed for the day to the shelter of a
distant bluff. Even the few horses remaining within
the barn were dozing. The dog, Neche, alone seemed
restless. He seemed to share with his master the
stormy passions of a cruel heart, for, with infinite
duplicity, he was lying low, pretending to be occupied
with a great beef shin-bone, while his evil eyes watched
intently the movements of half-a-dozen weary milch
cows, which were vainly endeavouring to reach the
shelter of their sheds. But the dog would not have it.
With a refinement of torture he would allow them to
mouch slowly towards their yard, then, just as they
were about to enter, he would fly into a dreadful
passion, and, limping vigorously at their heels, would
chase them out upon the prairie and then return once
more to his bone, only to await his opportunity of
repeating the operation.</p>
<p>Hervey and Prudence moved away and passed
down the trail. Neche reluctantly left his bone&ndash;&ndash;having
satisfied himself in a comprehensive survey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
that no canine interloper was about who could steal
his treasure during his absence&ndash;&ndash;and followed them.
He walked beside the girl without any sign of
pleasure. He was a dog that seemed to find no
joy in his master&#8217;s or mistress&#8217;s company. He seemed
to have no affection in him, and lived a life of mute
protest.</p>
<p>Hervey did not speak for a few minutes. It was
Prudence who broke the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it is something to do with Leslie&#8217;s
death that you want to talk to me about. I wondered
what your object was when you questioned me so
closely upon his dying words. Have you discovered
a fresh clue?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something more than a fresh clue.&#8221; Hervey had
relapsed into his old moroseness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; The girl&#8217;s face lit with an almost painful
eagerness. For a moment her own immediate
troubles were forgotten. A wild feeling surged up
in her heart which set the blood tingling in her veins,
and she waited almost breathlessly for her brother&#8217;s
next words.</p>
<p>Hervey displayed no haste. Rather he seemed as
though he would gain time.</p>
<p>&#8220;That message or advertisement in the paper.
Did you ever attempt to fathom its meaning? It
was something of a puzzle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence gazed up at the dark face beside her.
Hervey was looking down upon the dusty trail. His
look was one of profound thought. In reality he was
calculating certain chances.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried, but failed dismally. To me it conveyed
nothing beyond the fact that its author shot Leslie.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Just so. But before I tell you what I have
discovered you must understand the argument. That
line contained a message, a message so significant
that once read with understanding the mystery of
Grey&#8217;s death became one that a child might solve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&ndash;&ndash;yes. But the reading of it,&#8221; Prudence
exclaimed impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is intelligible to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a different girl to the one we have hitherto
seen who awaited the man&#8217;s next words. The old,
gentle calmness, the patient, even disposition had
given place to a world of vengeful thought. There
was a look in those usually soft brown eyes which
bore a strange resemblance to her brother&#8217;s. A
moment had arrived in her life when circumstances
aroused that other side of her character of which,
perhaps, even she had been ignorant. She learned
now of her own capacity for hatred and revenge.
Some preliminary warnings of these latent passions
had been given when Grey had died, but the moment
had passed without full realization. Now she felt
the ruthless sway of a wave of passionate hatred
which seemed to rise from somewhere in her heart
and creep over her faculties, locking her in an embrace
in which she felt her good motives and love being
crushed out of all recognition. There could be no
doubt as to the resemblance between these two people
in that one touch of nature. Hervey was a long time
in answering. He had not only to tell her of his
discovery, but there were his personal interests to
consider. He wished to re-assure himself of his own
advantage.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></div>
<p>&#8220;See here, Prue, what are you offering&ndash;&ndash;or rather,
is mother offering&ndash;&ndash;to that detective chap if he
discovers the murderer of Grey? Let us quite understand
one another. I don&#8217;t intend to part with my
discovery for nothing. I want money as badly as
anybody can want it. For a consideration I&#8217;ll tell
you, and prove to you, who murdered your man.
Provided, of course, the consideration is sufficiently
large. Otherwise I say nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment Prudence looked up from beneath
her sun-bonnet into her brother&#8217;s face. The scorn
in her look was withering. She had long since
learned the selfish nature of this man, but she had
not realized the full depths to which he had sunk
until now. He would sell his information. And the
thought scorched her brain with its dreadful significance.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much will buy you?&#8221; she asked at last.
And words fail to express the contempt she conveyed
in her tone.</p>
<p>Hervey laughed in a hollow fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t put it nicely,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Ah, how
much will buy me?&#8221; he added thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;When a man chooses the methods of Judas it
seems to me there need be no picking or choosing
of words. What do you want? How much?&#8221;</p>
<p>His answer came swiftly. He spoke eagerly, and
his tone was quite different from that which his
companion was used to. It was as if some deep
note in his more obscure nature had been struck, and
was now making itself heard above the raucous
jangling of discord by which his life was torn. His
words were almost passionate, and there was a ring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
of truth in them which was astonishing, coming from
such a man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Prue, I want to get away from here.
I want to get out upon the world again, alone, to
make my life what I choose. I can&#8217;t stand this
place; the quiet surroundings; the people with
whom I come in contact. It isn&#8217;t living; it&#8217;s existence,
and a hellish one at that. Look around;
prairie&ndash;&ndash;nothing but prairie. In the winter, snow,
endless snow; in the summer, the brown, scorched
prairie. The round of unrelieved, monotonous labour.
Farming; can mind of man conceive a life more
deadly? No&ndash;&ndash;no! I want to get away from it all;
back to the life in which I was my own master,
unfettered by duties and distasteful labours for which
I am responsible to others. From the beginning my
life has been a failure. But that was not originally
my fault. I worked hard, and my ideals were sound
and good. Then I met with misfortune. My life was
my own to make or mar after that; what I chose
to do with it was my own concern. But here I do
not live. I want the means to get away; to make
a fresh start in different surroundings. Sooner or
later I must go, or I shall become a raving maniac.
You can help me in this, even as I can help you in
the cause in which you are now spending and wasting
a lot of money. Get mother to give me fifteen
thousand dollars, not only as the price of my information,
but also to help me, as your brother, to make
another start. I am not wanted here, neither do I
want to remain.&#8221;</p>
<p>He ceased speaking. The truth had died out of
his tone when he mentioned the money, and his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
words were the specious wheedling of one who knows
the generous kindliness of those with whom he is
dealing. But Prudence gave no heed to anything
but that which found an answering chord in the
passionate emotion which swayed her. Hervey&#8217;s
appeal to get away drew from her some slight proportion
of sympathetic understanding, but her main
feeling was a desire to learn the truth which he had
discovered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes; but the clue&ndash;&ndash;discovery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First, the money. First, you must show me
that you will do this thing for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can only answer for myself. I can promise
nothing in mother&#8217;s name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but for yourself. You have an interest in
the farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will give you all I have&ndash;&ndash;all&ndash;&ndash;all&ndash;&ndash;if you
can prove to me, and in a court of law, who was the
man who shot Leslie Grey. I have saved nearly
everything I have made out of creamery. It is not
as large a sum as you require, but I can raise the
rest from mother. You shall have all you ask if you
can tell me this thing. But bear this in mind,
Hervey, you will have to prove your words. I give
you my word of honour that the money will be
forthcoming when you have accomplished this thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence spoke earnestly. But there was caution
in what she said. She did not trust her brother.
And though she was ready to pay almost anything
for the accomplishment of her purpose, she was not
going to allow herself to be tricked.</p>
<p>Hervey didn&#8217;t like these stipulations. He had
calculated to extort a price for his information only.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
The proving of his charge was a matter which would
entail time and trouble, and something else which he
did not care to contemplate; besides, he wanted to
get away. His recollection of his recent interview
with Iredale was still with him. And he remembered
well the rancher&#8217;s attitude. It struck him that George
Iredale would fight hard to prove his innocence. He
wondered uncomfortably if he could establish it.
No, he must make a better bargain than the girl
offered.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Prue, this is a matter of business.
There is no sentiment in it as far as I am concerned.
Your conditions are too hard. You pay me half the
money down when I give you the story. You can
pay the rest when I have carried out your further
conditions. It is only fair. Establishing a case in
the law courts is a thing that takes time. And, besides,
I have known guilty people to get off before
now. I can convince you of the truth of my case.
A jury is different.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence thought for a moment. They were
already within earshot of the thresher. And the droning
of the machine and the jerky spluttering of the
traction engine sounded pleasantly in the sultry
atmosphere. The dog hobbled lazily at her heels,
nor did he show the least sign of interest in his
surroundings. The wagons loaded with bountiful
sheaves were drawing up to the thresher from half-a-dozen
directions, whilst those already emptied were
departing for fresh supplies. Everywhere was a
wondrous peace; only in those two hearts was an
ocean of unrest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. If you can convince me, it shall be as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
you say. You shall have the money. The rest shall
remain until after the jury&#8217;s verdict. I am not prepared
to give you the money I have saved for any
tale you choose to concoct. Now let me have your
story. You have shown me too much of your sordid
craving to make me a ready believer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will believe me before I have finished, Prue,&#8221;
the man retorted, with a bitter laugh. &#8220;You will find
corroboration for what I have to tell in your own
knowledge of certain facts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So much the better for you. Go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of her cautious words Prudence waited with
nerves tingling and with rapidly beating heart for her
brother&#8217;s story. She did not know herself. She did
not understand the feelings which swayed her.
Hervey had an easier task than either of them believed.
Of late she had dwelt so long&ndash;&ndash;so intently&ndash;&ndash;upon
the matter under discussion that she was ready
to believe almost anything which offered a solution to
the ghastly mystery. But she did not know this.
Hervey told his story with all the cunning of a man
who appreciates the results which attach to the effect
of his words. He lost no detail which could further
his ends.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grey, on his deathbed, alluded to the notice in
the paper. He did so in answer to your question as
to who had shot him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was perfectly conscious?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some time before he died you and he had discussed
this notice, and he told you he was meditating
a coup in which that notice had afforded him his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
principal clue.&#8221; The girl nodded, and Hervey went
on. &#8220;Grey was a Customs officer. All his works
centred round contraband. No other work came into
his sphere of operations. Very well, the clue which
that notice afforded had to do with some illicit traffic.
The question is, What was the nature of that traffic?
Here is the obvious solution. &#8216;Yellow booming.&#8217;
What traffic is known by such a title as &#8216;Yellow&#8217; in
this country? There is only one. Traffic in Chinese!
The smuggling of Chinese across the border. And this
traffic was booming. Operations were being successfully
carried out. Where? The rest is easy. Somewhere
in Grey&#8217;s district. &#8216;Slump in Grey&#8217; could only
mean, under the circumstances, that Grey&#8217;s supervision
was avoided; that the work was carried out in spite
of him. You know&ndash;&ndash;everybody knows that Chinese
are smuggled into Canada at many points along the
border, and that opium is brought in at the same time.
Thus the poll tax and the opium tax are avoided by
men who make a living out of this traffic. The profit
is worth the risk. There is a fortune in smuggling
opium. The authorities are endeavouring to put it
down. It is well known that our cities are swarming
with Chinese for whom no poll tax has been paid.
And yet the legitimate importation of opium does not
increase. Rather has it decreased in consequence of
the prohibitive tax imposed upon it. Still, these
Chinese must have their opium. This then was the
coup poor Grey meditated. He had discovered a hotbed
of opium smuggling. If he succeeded in rounding
the smugglers up, it meant a great deal to his future
prospects. Is that all plain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes; go on.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></div>
<p>The girl&#8217;s eyes were gleaming strangely. She
followed every word her brother said with an intentness
which boded well for the result of his efforts.
The careful array of arguments was speciously
detailed. Now she waited for what was still to come
without any attempt at concealing her impatience.
For the time everything was forgotten while she
learned of the murderer of her first love. The peaceful
scene about her was set before eyes which no
longer gazed with intelligence upon their surroundings.
She was back in the farm parlour listening to Leslie&#8217;s
story of his hopes&ndash;&ndash;his aspirations. Every detail of
that evening was brought vividly back to her memory.
She remembered, too, that that was the night on
which Hervey had returned. There was a significance
in the thought that was not lost upon her.</p>
<p>Hervey had come to a stand, and Prudence placed
herself before him. Neche squatted beside her, and as
he sat his head reached up to her waist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. The question alone remains, who
along the border in this part of the country is
smuggling Chinese? And having found your man,
did he insert the notice in question?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&ndash;&ndash;and you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chance pointed out the man to me. And I have
ascertained the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And who is the murderer of Leslie?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was an impressive pause. Hervey gazed
down into the eager upturned face. The dog beside
the girl moved restlessly, and as he moved he made a
curious whining noise. His nose was held high in the
air, and his greenish eyes looked up towards the
spotless sun-bonnet.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The owner of Lonely Ranch. George Iredale!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hervey turned abruptly away. Neche had moved
a little way back along the trail and stood looking
about him. Then out on the still air rang a piercing,
hysterical laugh. And Prudence stretched out her
arm and clutched at the barbed-wire fence-post as
though her mirth had overcome her.</p>
<p>Hervey looked sharply round upon her. Neche
gave a low growl, the noise seemed to have offended
him; then he limped off down the trail back to the
house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE MAGGOT AT THE CORE</h3>
</div>
<p>Hervey&#8217;s look of surprise quickly changed to one
of displeasure. To him his sister&#8217;s attitude merely
suggested incredulity, nothing more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he said at last, as her laugh died out
suddenly.</p>
<p>Prudence turned upon him with a strange fierceness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on. You must tell me more than that to
convince me. George Iredale&ndash;&ndash;smuggler, murderer!
You must be mad!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hervey kept himself well in hand. He was playing
for a great stake. He would lose nothing through
any ill-advised bluster.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was never more sane in my life,&#8221; he answered
coldly. &#8220;I am ready to prove my words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Prove them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence&#8217;s face and the tone of her voice were icy.
Her mouth was set firmly, the declined corners testifying
to the hard setting of her jaws. She looked straight
into her brother&#8217;s face with an intentness which made
him lower his eyes. He had no conception of the fires
which he had stirred within her. One unconquerable
desire swayed her. This man must tell her all he
knew. Then she would refute every word, tell him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
what manner of man he was, and have him driven
from the farm. She hated him at that moment as
she might hate a rattlesnake. She was filled with a
longing to strike him, her own brother, to the earth.</p>
<p>Hervey spoke in measured, even tones.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know the ranch and its surroundings well.
You have been there. You have heard the so-called
owl cries which greet the visitor upon entering the
valley. Those are not owl cries at all, but the work
of human sentries always on the watch, ready to give
immediate alarm at the approach of danger. The
secret of the ranch lies in the graveyard.&#8221; Prudence
started. &#8220;That is where I made my first discovery,
a discovery of which I should not have understood
the significance but for your experiences when picnicking
in that region two or three days before. At
the time I speak of I had come upon the cemetery for
the first time. I had Neche with me. I paused at
the broken fence which surrounded it, and surveyed
the overgrown graves. While I did so, Neche
mouched about among them with canine inquisitiveness.
Suddenly he became agitated, and showed
signs of having hit upon a hot scent. I watched him
curiously. He ran up a path and then paused at one
of the stone-marked graves. Here he began to tear
wildly at the edge of it. I followed him up and saw
that he had dug a hole below the stone. I dragged
him away, and found that beneath the stone the grave
was hollow. Then I moved hastily away, and, taking
the dog to the ruined dead-house, put him on the
scent again. He dashed in, whining excitedly as he
went. It was while I stood watching for his return
that I discovered the most significant point. Directly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
under my feet, somewhere under the ground, I heard
a sound of hammering. Then I knew that the graveyard
was no longer the resting-place of the dead, but
the abode of the living. Instantly I remembered all
the details of your ghost story, and determined to
witness for myself the scenes you had observed. Settle
it for once and all in your mind. I was troubled with
no superstitious fears upon the matter. I guessed the
truth.&#8221; Hervey broke off, but resumed quickly.
&#8220;That evening I returned to the graveyard surreptitiously,
and took up a position in the black shelter of
the surrounding woods. I saw all you saw. But the
robed figures were not the ghosts which you thought
them to be; they were Chinese, carrying their boxes
and bundles of personal luggage, and, I have no doubt,
a cargo of opium. Then I understood that the graveyard
was honeycombed with cellars, and that this
place formed the central dep&ocirc;t of Iredale&#8217;s traffic and
his distributing station. I can understand how these
&#8216;yellow-devils&#8217; are distributed by means of loaded
hayracks and such things. The point I have not
fathomed is the means by which the &#8216;goods&#8217; are
brought into the country. I suggest the only means
I can think of as being almost without risk, and that
is the lake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hervey paused to watch the effect of his story.
Prudence gave no sign. She no longer looked at her
companion, but away across the harvested fields in the
direction of Iredale&#8217;s ranch. As he waited for her
comment her lips moved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; was all she said; and the man proceeded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an unconscious expression which, in the
first flush of discovery I made use of which ultimately
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
gave me a clue to the rest. As realization of Iredale&#8217;s
doings came to me I thought of the notorious &#8216;Traffic
in Yellow.&#8217; That night I pondered long over the
whole thing. I had learned to like Iredale better
than any man I have ever known. He had always
seemed such an honest, straightforward man. And
all of you folks were so fond of him. It was a painful
awakening; but there was worse to come, for, as I lay
awake thinking, there flashed through my brain the
recollection of what you had told me of Grey&#8217;s death
and his reference to the notice in the paper. Instantly
the interpretation of that line came to me. It related
to the yellow traffic. And I shuddered as I reviewed
the possibilities which my discovery opened up. I
couldn&#8217;t rest. A feverish desire to know the worst
assailed me. I questioned you as you may remember,
and, with every reply you gave me, my fears received
confirmation. In the end I could no longer keep
silence, and my anger drove me to a course which I
have since almost regretted, for it has destroyed the
last vestige of the regard I entertained for the man
you have all so liked and respected. I went over to
the ranch and challenged George Iredale&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the night of the storm. The night he visited
me. Go on.&#8221; Prudence&#8217;s face was ghastly in its
pallor. She gave no other sign of emotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, on the night of the storm. I taxed him with
smuggling. He admitted it. I taxed him with the
authorship of that notice&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; The girl leant forward in her eagerness.</p>
<p>&#8220;He did not contradict it. His attitude was a tacit
admission. That is my evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hervey ceased speaking, and a long pause followed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
The man waited. He did not wish to hurry her. He
was not blind to the fact that she regarded Iredale
with something more than mere friendly feeling, and,
with fiendish cunning, he had played upon the knowledge
by his allusions to his own regard for the man
and the trust which they all placed in him. This
woman&#8217;s love for Iredale he knew would help him;
for, gradually, as the damning evidence he had
produced filtered through her armour of loyal affection,
her hatred for the man would be doubled and trebled.
In this Hervey displayed a knowledge of human
nature which one would scarcely have credited him
with.</p>
<p>At last Prudence turned. The pallor of her face
was unchanged. Only the look in her eyes had
altered. The horror which had shone there had
become a world of piteous appeal. All her soul
shone forth in those sweet, brown eyes. Surely it
must have needed a heart of stone to resist her. Her
body was leaning forward, her two brown hands were
held out towards him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it! I can&#8217;t believe it! George is
no&ndash;&ndash;murderer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hervey&#8217;s great eyes lowered before that heartful
look. His face was a study in hopelessness. From
his expression of deep sorrow Iredale might have been
his own brother who was accused of murder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid there is no hope of what you say, Prue.
Leslie was conscious; he knew what he was saying.
<i>Iredale had every reason for shooting him</i>. The
circumstantial evidence is damning. The most
sceptical jury would be convinced.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O God! O God! And he has asked me to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
his wife.&#8221; Prudence covered her face with her hands,
and her body heaved with great, passionate sobs.</p>
<p>Hervey started at the words. His face lit up with
a wicked joy. This was better than he had expected.
George should pay dearly for his refusal to buy his
silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;You say he dared to propose to you with that foul
crime upon his soul? He is a worse villain than I
had believed. By heavens, he shall swing for his
crime! I had hoped that my news had come in time
to save you this cruel wrong. The scum! The foul,
black-hearted scum!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hervey&#8217;s rage was melodramatic. But the girl,
even in the depths of her misery and distraught
feelings, was impressed. Her heart cried out for
her lover, and proclaimed his innocence in terms
which would not be silenced. His image rose before
her mind&#8217;s eye, and she looked upon that kindly,
strong face, the vigorous bearing of that manly figure,
and the story she had just listened to became dwarfed
as her faith in him rose superior to the evidence of her
senses. It could not be. Her quivering lips struggled
to frame the words she longed to utter, but no sound
came. Hervey&#8217;s words, his attitude, his appearance of
deep, honest sorrow for his sister paralyzed her faculties
and hope died down in her heart.</p>
<p>The man moved forward to her side, and touched
her gently on the shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Prue, we had best go back to the house. I
can do no work to-day. You, too, need quiet for
reflection. The heartless villain!&#8221; And he harped
upon the information his sister had provided him
with.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></div>
<p>Prudence allowed herself to be led. She did not
care whither she went or what happened. She was
incapable of reasoning. She was stunned by the cruel
blow that had fallen. Later she would recover herself,
for all such blows are but passing; in waking moments
mind and reason cannot long remain inert and sanity
obtain. For the present she was a mere automaton.</p>
<p>Hervey grew uncomfortable at the girl&#8217;s prolonged
silence. He cared nothing for her feelings; he cared
nothing for the heart he had broken. He cared only
for the money he had not yet secured. He realized
only too well that, whatever protest his sister might
offer, he had convinced her of Iredale&#8217;s guilt; it was
only a question of time before she admitted it openly.
But some feeling of doubt prompted him to secure
his wage without delay. Thus his greed rushed him
on to a false trail.</p>
<p>Halfway to the house he broke the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Prue, you cannot refute my evidence.
Iredale is the man you have all been seeking. I
have served you well. You yourself have escaped a
course which would have brought you lifelong regret.
Think of it! What would it have meant to you had
you married the man? Terrible! Terrible!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl looked up. There was a wild, hunted look
in her eyes. Her brother&#8217;s words had in some way
driven her at bay. He had struck a chord which had
set her every nerve on edge, and in doing so had
upset all his best-laid schemes. A flood of passionate
protest surged to her lips and flowed forth in a seething
torrent. She remembered what his story had
been told for; she had forgotten for the moment, so
well had he acted his part, and had thought only that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
what he had said was the outcome of his regard for
her. Now she turned upon him like a tigress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Judas!&#8221; she cried, a flush of rage sweeping up
into her face as the words hissed from between her
teeth. &#8220;You have come to sell this man. Your
thoughts have nothing to do with the meting out of
human justice. You want a price for your filthy
work. I loathe you! What curse is on our family
that you should have been born into it? You shall
have your money; do you hear? You shall have it,
and with it goes my curse. But not yet. My conditions
are not fulfilled. I do not believe you; your
story has not convinced me; I can see no reason in
it. Ha, ha!&#8221; and she laughed hysterically. &#8220;You
cannot make me believe it because I will not. You
shall have your money, I will not go back on my
word; but you must fulfil the conditions. You must
convince me of the reason in your story. You will
earn your pay as you have never earned anything
in your life. Shall I tell you how you will earn it?
You will prove your story before judge and jury.
When you have convinced them you will have convinced
me. Then I will pay you. My God, what
taint has brought such blood into the veins of our
flesh? If Iredale is the murderer he shall pay the
extreme penalty, and you&ndash;&ndash;whether you like it or
not&ndash;&ndash;shall be instrumental in that punishment. You
shall be his accuser; you shall see him to the scaffold.
And after it is over, after you have received the sum
of your blood-money, I will tell the world of your
doings. That you&ndash;&ndash;my brother&ndash;&ndash;demanded a price
for your work. They&ndash;&ndash;the world&ndash;&ndash;shall know you;
shall loathe you as I loathe you. You shall be an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
outcast wherever you go, stamped with the brand of
Judas&ndash;&ndash;the most despised of all men. Better for you
if you stood in George Iredale&#8217;s place on the scaffold
than face the world so branded. Oh, you wretched
man, you have destroyed my life&ndash;&ndash;my all! Go, and
bring the police. Go to those whose duty it is to
listen to such stories as yours. Now I will drive you
to it; you shall go, whether you like it or not. Refuse,
and I will lay the information and force you to
become a witness. You thought you were dealing
with a soft, silly woman; you thought to cajole
the price out of me, and then, having obtained what
you desired, to leave me to do the work. Fool!
You will face George Iredale, the accuser and the
accused. You shall earn your money. I know the
ways of such men as you. Do you know what you
are doing? Do you know the name that such work
as yours goes by? It is blackmail!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl paused for breath. Then she went on
with a bitterness that was almost worse than the
contempt in all she had said before.</p>
<p>&#8220;But rest content. Every penny you have asked
for shall be yours when Iredale&#8217;s crimes are expiated.
Nor shall I give to the world the story of my brother&#8217;s
perfidy until such time as you have gone out of our
world for ever. Go, go from me now; I will not walk
beside you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hervey&#8217;s face was a study in villainous expression
as he listened to his sister&#8217;s hysterical denunciation.
He knew the reason of her tirade. He knew that she
loved Iredale. He had convinced her of this lover&#8217;s
crimes; he knew this. And now, woman-like, she
turned upon him&ndash;&ndash;for his hand, his words had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
destroyed her happiness. But her words smote hard.
The lowest natures care not what others think of
them, but those others&#8217; spoken thoughts have a
different effect. So it was with Hervey. It mattered
nothing to him what the girl thought of him&ndash;&ndash;what
the world thought of him. But words&ndash;&ndash;abuse&ndash;&ndash;had
still power to move him.</p>
<p>She struck the right note when she said the money
down was what he wanted. Now he saw that he had
over-reached himself, and he cursed himself for having
trusted to a woman&#8217;s promise. There was but one
thing left for him to do. He controlled himself well
when he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, sister,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In spite of what you
say, you are going back on your word. You should
have thought to fling dirt before you entered into a
compact with me. However, I care nothing for all
your threats. As you have said, I want money.
Nothing else matters to me. So I will go to Winnipeg
and see this thing through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly will have to do so. Andy shall
drive you into town to-night, and I could find it in
my heart to wish that I might never see your face
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221; Hervey laughed harshly. &#8220;As you
wish. I accept your commands. See you as readily
fulfil your part of the contract when the time comes.
You do not hoodwink me again with impunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so brother and sister parted. The girl walked
on to the house, her feet dragging wearily over the
dusty trail. Hervey paused irresolutely. His burning
eyes, filled with a look of bitter hatred, gazed after
the slight figure of his sister, whose life he had so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
wantonly helped to wreck. Then he laughed cruelly
and turned abruptly back on his tracks and returned
once more to the harvesters.</p>
<p>Prudence gained the house and went straight to
her room. She wanted to be alone. She wanted to
straighten out the chaos of her thoughts. She heard
the cheery voices of her mother and Alice talking in
the kitchen. She heard the clatter of plates and
dishes, and she knew that these two were washing up.
But beyond that she noticed nothing; she did not
even see the plump figure of Sarah Gurridge approaching
the house from the direction of Leonville.</p>
<p>Once in her own little room she flung herself into
an arm-chair and sat staring straight in front of her.
Her paramount feeling was one of awful horror. The
mystery was solved, and George Iredale was the
murderer. The metal alarm clock ticked away upon
the wooden top of her bureau, and the sound pervaded
the room with its steady throb. Her feelings,
her thoughts, seemed to pulsate in concert with its
rhythm. The words which expressed her dominant
emotions hammered themselves into her brain with
the steady precision of the ticking&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;George Iredale, the murderer of Leslie Grey!&#8221;</p>
<p>The moments passed, but time brought the girl
no relief. All thought of the man who had told her
of this thing had passed from her. Only the fact
remained. Slowly, as she sat with nerves tingling
and whirling brain, a flush of blood mounted to her
head, her brain became hot, and she seemed to be
looking out on a red world. The ticking of the clock
grew fainter and more distant. The room seemed to
diminish in size, while the objects about her drew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
nearer and nearer. A sense of compression was
hers, although she seemed to be gazing out over
some great distance with everything around her in
due perspective.</p>
<p>Mechanically she rose and opened the window;
then she returned to her chair with something of the
action of an automaton.</p>
<p>And as she sat the blood seemed to recede from
her brain and an icy dew broke out upon her forehead.
She was numbed with a sort of paralysis now,
and the measured beat of the clock no longer pounded
out the words of her thought. Only her heart beat
painfully, and she was conscious of a horrible void.
Something was wrong with her, but she was incapable
of realizing what it was.</p>
<p>She moved, the chair creaked under her, and again
thought flowed through her brain. It came with a
rush; the deadly numbness had gone as quickly as
it had come, and once more her faculties worked
feverishly. Now she realized pain, horror, despair,
hopelessness in a sudden, overwhelming flood. She
shrank back deeper into the chair as though to avoid
physical blows which were being rained upon her by
some unseen hand.</p>
<p>Presently she started up with a faint cry. She
walked across the room and back again. She paused
at the bureau, muttering&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be! It can&#8217;t be!&#8221; she said to herself, in
an agony of terror. &#8220;George is too good, too honest.
Ah!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her love cried out for the man, but reason checked
her while her heart tried to rush her into extravagant
hopefulness. Iredale had admitted the smuggling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
She had seen with her own eyes the doings at the
graveyard. And therein lay the key to everything.
Leslie had said so with his dying breath. But as this
thought came to her it was chased away by her love
in a fresh burst of fervour. She could not believe it.
There must be some awful, some horrible mistake.</p>
<p>Slowly her mind steadied itself; the long years of
calmness which she had spent amidst the profound
peace of the prairie helped her. She gripped herself
lest the dreadful thought of what she had heard
should drive her to madness. She went over what
she had been told with a keen examination. She
listened to her own arguments for and against the
man she loved. She went back to the time when
Leslie had told her of his &#8220;coup.&#8221; She remembered
everything so well. She paused as she recollected
her dead lover&#8217;s anger at George&#8217;s coming to the
party. And, for a moment, her heart almost stood
still. She asked herself, had she misinterpreted his
meaning? Had there been something underlying
his expressed displeasure at George&#8217;s coming which
related to what he knew of his, George Iredale&#8217;s,
doings at the ranch? Every word he had said came
back to her. She remembered that he had finished
up his protest with a broken sentence.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;And besides&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a significance in those words now which
she could not help dwelling upon. Then she put the
thought from her as her faith in her lover re-asserted
itself. But the effort was a feeble one; her love was
being overwhelmed by the damning evidence.</p>
<p>She moved restlessly from the bureau to the
window. The curtained aperture looked out upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
the far-reaching cornfields, which were now only a
mass of brown stubble. In the distance, beyond the
dyke, she could see the white steam of the traction-engine
and the figures of many men working. The
carts and racks were moving in the picture, but for
all else the view was one of peaceful, unbroken
calm.</p>
<p>Her mind passed on to the time when the party
had broken up. She remembered how in searching
for Iredale she had found the two men quarrelling, or
something in that nature. Again Leslie had been on
the verge of telling her something, but the moment
had gone by and he had kept silence. She tried to
deny the significance of these things, but reason
checked her, and her heart sank to zero. And she
no longer tried to defend her lover.</p>
<p>Then came the recollection of that picnic. The
screech-owls; the boats laden with their human freight
moving suspiciously over the waters of the great lake.
She thought of the graveyard and the ghostly procession.
And all the time her look was hardening
and the protests of her heart slowly died out. If she
had doubted Hervey&#8217;s words, all these things of which
she now thought were facts evident to her own senses.
The hard light in her eyes changed to the bright
flash of anger. This man had come to her with his
love, she reminded herself, and she had yielded to
him all that she had power to bestow. The brown
eyes grew darker until their glowing depths partially
resembled those of her brother.</p>
<p>As the anger in her heart rose her pain increased,
and she recoiled in horror at the thought that this
man had dared to offer her his love while his hands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
were stained with black crime. At best he was a
law-breaker; at the worst he was&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>She paced her room with agitated steps. The
blood rose to her head again, and she felt dizzy and
dazed. What could she do? What must she do?
She longed for some one to whom she could tell all
that was in her heart, but she could not speak of it&ndash;&ndash;she
dared not. She felt that she must be going mad.
Through all her agony of mind she knew that she
loved this man who was&ndash;&ndash;a murderer.</p>
<p>She told herself that she hated him, and she knew
that she lied to deceive herself. No, no, he was not
guilty. He had not been proved guilty, and no man
is guilty until he is proved so. Thoughts crowded
thick and fast on her sorely-taxed brain, and again
and again her hands went up to her head with the
action of one who is mentally distracted. But in
spite of the conflict that raged within her the angry
light in her eyes grew, and a look which was out of
all keeping with the sweet face was slowly settling
itself upon her features. Again she cried in her heart,
&#8220;What shall I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly a light broke through her darkness and
revealed to her a definite course. This man must
not be judged, at least by her, without a hearing.
Why should she not go to him? Why not challenge
him with the story? If he were the murderer, perhaps
he would strike her to the earth, and add her to
the list of his victims. She laughed bitterly. It
would be good to die by his hand, she thought.
Under any circumstances life was not worth living.
The thought fascinated her. Yes, she would do it.
Then her spirit of justice rose and rebelled. No.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
He would then go unpunished. Leslie&#8217;s death would
remain unavenged. The murderer would have
triumphed.</p>
<p>She thought long; she moved wildly about the
room. And as the hours passed a demon seemed to
come to her and take hold of her. It was the demon
which looked out of her brother&#8217;s eyes, and which
now looked out of hers. He whispered to her, and her
willing ears listened to all he said. Her heart, torn by
conflicting passions, drank in the cruel promptings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not kill him? Why not kill him?&#8221; suggested
the demon. &#8220;If he is guilty, kill him, and your life
will not have been lived in vain. If he be a murderer
it were but justice. You will have fulfilled your
promise of vengeance. After that you could turn
your hand against yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>And her heart echoed the question, &#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>For nearly an hour she continued to pace her room.
Yes, yes! Hers was the right, she told herself. If
he were the murderer she did not care to live. They
should die together; they should journey beyond
together. She thought over all the details, and all
the time the demon looked out of her eyes and
jogged her with fresh arguments when her heart failed.
She knew where her brother kept his pistols. She
would wait until he had set out for Winnipeg. Then,
on the morrow, she would ride over to Lonely Ranch.</p>
<p>She nursed her anger; she encouraged it at every
turn. And she longed for the morrow. But outwardly
she grew calm. Only her eyes betrayed her.
And they were not the eyes of perfect sanity. They
glowed with a lurid fire, the fire which shone in the
fierce, dark eyes of her brother.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>AN ECHO FROM THE ALASKAN MOUNTAINS</h3>
</div>
<p>Alice searched all over the farm for her friend.
The last place in which she thought of looking was
the little bedroom the two girls shared. Here at
length she arrived, and a shock awaited her.</p>
<p>Prudence was sitting beside the window. She was
gazing out at the bare, harvested fields, nor did she
turn at her friend&#8217;s approach. It was not until Alice
spoke that she looked round.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here you are, Prue! Why, whatever is the
matter?&#8221; she exclaimed, as she noted the grey pallor
of the face before her; the drawn lines about the
mouth, the fiercely burning eyes. &#8220;You poor soul,
you are ill; and you never told me a word about it.
I have been looking everywhere for you. It is
tea-time. What is it, dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I look ill?&#8221; Prudence asked wearily. She
passed her hand across her forehead. She was almost
dazed. Then she went on as she turned again to the
window: &#8220;I&#8217;m all right; my head is aching&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s
all. I don&#8217;t think I want any tea.&#8221; The next
moment she was all alertness. &#8220;Has Hervey returned
from the fields?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hervey? Yes; why? He&#8217;s returned and gone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
away again; gone into Winnipeg. He nearly frightened
poor mother Hephzy out of her wits. Came in
all of a sudden and declared he must hurry off to
Winnipeg at once, and he wanted Andy to drive
him. You know his way. He wouldn&#8217;t give any
explanation. He was like a bear to his mother. My
fingers were just itching to slap his face. But come
along, dear, you must have some tea. It&#8217;ll do your
head good.&#8221;</p>
<p>While she was speaking Alice&#8217;s eyes never left her
friend&#8217;s face. There was something about Prudence&#8217;s
expression she didn&#8217;t like. Her mind at once reverted
to thoughts of fever and sunstroke and such
things, but she said nothing that might cause alarm.
She merely persisted when the other shook her head.</p>
<p>Eventually her persuasions prevailed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother Hephzy&#8217;s fretting away down-stairs and
Sarah is backing her up. The long-suffering Mary
has been catching it in consequence. So come along
and be your most cheerful self, Prue. The poor old
dears must be humoured.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Alice with gentle insistence led her companion
down to the parlour.</p>
<p>&#8220;And where, miss, have you been all this precious
time?&#8221; asked Mrs. Malling, when the two girls
reached the parlour. &#8220;Sleeping, I&#8217;ll be bound, to
judge by them spectacles around your eyes. There&#8217;s
no git-up about young folk now-a-days,&#8221; she went on,
turning to Sarah. &#8220;Six hours&#8217; sleep for healthy-minded
women, I says; not an hour more nor an
hour less. Sister Emma was allus one o&#8217; them for
her sy-esta.&#8221; Then she turned back to Prudence.
&#8220;Maybe she learned you, my girl.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been sleeping, mother,&#8221; Prudence protested,
taking her place at the table. &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel
very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you don&#8217;t say so,&#8221; exclaimed the old lady, all
anxiety at once. &#8220;An&#8217; why didn&#8217;t you tell me before?
Now maybe you&#8217;ve got a touch o&#8217; the sun?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been faint and giddy?&#8221; asked Sarah,
fixing her quiet eyes upon the girl&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think so. I&#8217;ve got a headache&ndash;&ndash;nothing
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah; cold bath and lemon soda,&#8221; observed her
mother practically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tea, and be left alone,&#8221; suggested Sarah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Nature designs all human ills, but in the making
Suggests the cure which best is for the taking.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her steady old eyes seemed able to penetrate mere
outward signs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite right, &#8216;Aunt&#8217; Sarah,&#8221; said Alice decidedly.
&#8220;Leave the nostrums and quackeries alone. Prue
will be all right after a nice cup of tea. Now,
mother Hephzy, one of your best for the invalid,
and, please, I&#8217;ll have some more ham.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That you shall, you flighty harum-scarum. And
to think o&#8217; the likes o&#8217; you dictating to me about
nostrums and physickings,&#8221; replied the farm-wife,
with a comfortable laugh. &#8220;I&#8217;ll soon be having Mary
teaching me to toss a buckwheat &#8216;slap-jack.&#8217; Now
see an&#8217; cut from the sides o&#8217; that ham where the
curin&#8217;s primest. I do allow as the hams didn&#8217;t cure
just so, last winter. Folks at my board must have of
the best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never knew any one to get anything else here,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
laughed Alice. Then she turned her head sharply
and sat listening.</p>
<p>Mrs. Malling looked over towards the window.
Prudence silently sipped her tea, keeping her eyes
lowered as much as possible. She knew that, in
spite of their talk, these kindly people were worried
about her, and she tried hard to relieve their anxiety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one for us,&#8221; said Alice, as the sound of
horse&#8217;s hoofs came in through the open window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one from Lakeville, I expect,&#8221; said Mrs.
Malling, making a guess.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s George Iredale&#8217;s horse,&#8221; said Sarah, who
had detected the sound of a pacer&#8217;s gait.</p>
<p>Prudence looked up in a startled, frightened way.
Sarah was looking directly at her. She made no
further comment aloud, but contented herself with a
quiet mental note.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something wrong,&#8221; she thought; &#8220;and it&#8217;s to do
with him. Poor child, poor child. Maybe she&#8217;s
fretting herself because&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Her reflections were abruptly broken off as the
sound of a man&#8217;s voice hailing at the front door
penetrated to the parlour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any one in?&#8221; cried the voice; and instantly
Alice sprang to her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Robb!&#8221; she exclaimed. There was a clatter
as her chair fell back behind her; she nearly fell over
it, reached the door, and the next moment those in
the parlour heard the sound of joyous exclamations
proceeding from the hall.</p>
<p>Prudence&#8217;s expression was a world of relief. Her
mother was overjoyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is real good. Bring him in! Bring him in,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
Miss Thoughtless! Don&#8217;t keep him there a-philandering
when there&#8217;s good fare in the parlour!&#8221;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Love feeds on kisses, we read in ancient lay;
Meaning the love of yore; not of to-day,&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>murmured Sarah, with a pensive smile, while she
turned expectantly to greet the visitor.</p>
<p>Radiant, her face shining with conscious happiness,
Alice led her fianc&eacute; into the room. And Robb
Chillingwood found himself sitting before the farm-wife&#8217;s
generous board almost before he was aware of
it. While he was being served he had to face a
running fire of questions from, at least, three of the
ladies present.</p>
<p>Robb was a cheerful soul and ever ready with a
pleasant laugh. This snatched holiday from a stress
of under-paid work was like a &#8220;bunk&#8221; to a schoolboy.
It was more delightful to him by reason of the
knowledge that he would have to pay up for it afterwards
with extra exertions and overtime work.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t tell us when you were coming,&#8221; said
Alice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t know myself. Thought I&#8217;d ride over from
Iredale&#8217;s place on spec&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re come from there now?&#8221; asked Mrs.
Malling.</p>
<p>Prudence looked up eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I&#8217;ve just bought all his stock for a Scotch
client of mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scotch?&#8221; Sarah turned away with a motion of
disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;What, has George sold all his beasties at last?&#8221;
exclaimed the farm-wife.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes. Didn&#8217;t you know? He&#8217;s giving up
his ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robb looked round the table in surprise. There
was a pause. Then Mrs. Malling broke it&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has spoken of it&ndash;&ndash;hinted. But we wasn&#8217;t
expectin&#8217; it so soon. He&#8217;s made his pile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he must have done so,&#8221; said Robb readily.
&#8220;The price he parted with his cattle to me for was
ridiculous. I shall make a large profit out of my
client. It&#8217;ll all help towards furnishing, Al,&#8221; he went
on, turning to his fianc&eacute;e.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you are doing well now, Robb,&#8221; the
girl replied, with a happy smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then the man turned to Mrs. Malling.
&#8220;We&#8217;re going to get married this fall. I hope Alice
has been learning something of housekeeping&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;with
a laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes. Alice knows a deal more than she
reckons to let on, I guess,&#8221; said the farm-wife, with a
fat chuckle.</p>
<p>Prudence now spoke for the first time since Robb&#8217;s
arrival. She looked up suddenly, and, though she
tried hard to speak conversationally, there was a
slightly eager ring in her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;When is George Iredale going to leave the
ranch?&#8221;</p>
<p>Robb turned to her at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say. Not yet, I should think. He seems
to have made no preparations. Besides, I&#8217;ve got to
see him again in a day or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you will stay out here?&#8221; asked Alice
eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no.&#8221; Robb shook his head with a comical
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
expression of chagrin. &#8220;Can&#8217;t be done, I&#8217;m afraid.
But I&#8217;ll come over here when I&#8217;m in the neighbourhood,
if possible.&#8221; Then to Mrs. Malling,
&#8220;May I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, certainly,&#8221; said the farm-wife, with characteristic
heartiness. &#8220;If you come to this district
without so much as a look in here, well, you can
just pass right along for the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the meal was over the old lady rose from
the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alice,&#8221; said she, &#8220;you stay right here. Sarah and
I&#8217;ll clear away. Prudence, my girl, just lie down and
get your rest. Maybe you&#8217;ll feel better later on.
Come along, Sarah; the young folks can get on
comfortably without us for once.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence made no attempt to do as her mother
suggested. She moved about the room, helping with
the work. Then the two old ladies adjourned to the
kitchen. Robb and Alice had moved over to the
well-worn sofa at the far end of the room, and
Prudence took up her position at the open window.
She seemed to have no thought of leaving the lovers
together; in fact, it seemed as though she had forgotten
their existence altogether. She stood staring
out over the little front garden with hard, unmeaning
eyes. From her expression it is doubtful if she saw
what her eyes looked upon. Her thoughts were
of other matters that concerned only herself and
another.</p>
<p>The low tones of the lovers sounded monotonously
through the room. They, too, were now wrapt in
their own concerns, and had forgotten the presence
of the girl at the window. They had so much to say
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
and so little time in which to say it; for Robb had
to make Ainsley that night.</p>
<p>The cool August evening was drawing on. The
threshing gang was returning from the fields, and the
purple haze of sundown was rising above the eastern
horizon; Prudence did not move. Her hands were
clasped before her; her pale face might have been
of carved stone. There was only the faintest sign
of life about her, and that was the steady rise and
fall of her bosom.</p>
<p>A cool breeze rustled in through the open
window and set the curtains moving. Then all
became still again. Two birds squabbled viciously
amongst the branches of a blue-gum in the little
patch of a garden, but Prudence&#8217;s gaze was still
directed towards the horizon. She saw nothing; she
felt nothing but the pain which her own thoughts
brought her.</p>
<p>Suddenly the sound of something moving outside
became audible. There was the noisy yawn of some
large animal rising from its rest. Then came the
slow, heavy patter of the creature&#8217;s feet. Neche
approached the window. His fierce-looking head
stood well above the sill. His greenish eyes looked
up solemnly at the still figure framed in the opening.
His ears twitched attentively. There was no friendly
motion of his straight, lank tail; but his appearance
was undoubtedly expressive of some sort of well-meaning,
canine regard. Whether the dog understood
and sympathized with the girl at the window
it would have taken something more than a keen
observer to have said. But in his strangely unyielding
fashion he was certainly struggling to convey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
something to this girl from whom he was accustomed
to receive nothing but kindness.</p>
<p>For some moments he stood thus, quite still. His
unkempt body rose and fell under his wiry coat. He
was a vast beast, and the wolf-grey and black of his
colouring was horribly suggestive of his ancestry.
Presently he lifted one great paw to the window.
Balancing his weight upon his only serviceable hind-leg,
he lifted himself and stood with both front feet
upon the sill, and pushed his nose against the girl&#8217;s
dress. She awoke from her reverie at the touch, and
her hands unclasped, and she slowly caressed the
bristly head. The animal seemed to appreciate the
attention, for, with his powerful paws, he drew himself
further into the room.</p>
<p>The girl offered no objection. She paid no heed
to what he was doing. Her hand merely rested on
his head, and she thought no more about him. Finding
himself unrebuffed Neche made further efforts;
then, suddenly, he became aware of the other
occupants of the room. Quick as a flash his nose
was directed towards the old sofa on which they were
seated, and his eyes, like two balls of phosphorescent
light, gleamed in their direction. He became motionless
at once. It seemed as though he were uncertain
of something.</p>
<p>He was inclined to resent the presence of these
two, but the caress of the soft, warm hand checked
any hostile demonstration beyond a whine, half
plaintive, half of anger.</p>
<p>The disturbing sound drew Alice&#8217;s attention, and
she looked over to where Prudence was standing; it
was then she encountered the unblinking stare of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
hound&#8217;s wicked eyes. The sight thrilled her for a
moment, nor could she repress a slight shudder.
She nudged her companion and drew his attention
without speaking. Robb followed the direction of
her gaze, and a silence followed whilst he surveyed
the strange apparition.</p>
<p>He could only see the dog&#8217;s head&ndash;&ndash;the rest of the
creature was hidden behind the window curtain&ndash;&ndash;and
its enormous size suggested the great body and
powerful limbs which remained concealed. To Robb
there was a suggestion of hell about the cruel lustre
of the relentless eyes.</p>
<p>At last he broke into a little nervous laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I thought for the moment
I&#8217;d got &#8217;em. Gee-whizz! The brute looks like the
devil himself. What is it? Whose?&#8221;</p>
<p>Without replying, Alice called to her friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let Neche come in, Prue,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That is&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;dubiously&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;if
you think it&#8217;s safe.&#8221; Then she turned
to Robb. &#8220;He&#8217;s so savage that I&#8217;m afraid of him.
Still, with Prue here, I think he&#8217;ll be all right; he&#8217;s
devoted to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the sound of the girl&#8217;s voice Prudence turned
back from the window like one awakening from a
dream. Her eyes still had a far-away look in them,
and though she had heard the voice it seemed doubtful
as to whether she had taken the meaning of the
words. For a moment her eyes rested on Alice&#8217;s
face, then they drooped to the dog at her side, but
Alice was forced to repeat her question before the
other moved. Then, in silence, she stepped back and
summoned the dog to her with an encouraging chirrup.
Neche needed no second bidding. There was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
scramble and a scraping of sharp claws upon the
woodwork, then the animal stood in the room. And
his attitude as he eyed the two seated upon the sofa
said as plainly as possible, &#8220;Well, which one is it to
be first?&#8221;</p>
<p>Robb felt uneasy. Alice was decidedly alarmed at
the dog&#8217;s truculent appearance.</p>
<p>But the tension was relieved a moment later by the
brute&#8217;s own strange behaviour. Suddenly, without
the slightest warning, Neche plumped down upon his
hind-quarters. His pricked ears drooped, and his two
fore paws began to beat a sort of tattoo upon the
floor. Then followed a broken whine, tremulous and
blandishing, and the great head moved from side to
side with that curious movement which only dogs use
to express their gladness. Then the strange, three-legged
beast went further. Down he threw himself
full length upon the floor and grovelled effusively,
whining and scraping the boards in a perfect fervour
of abject delight.</p>
<p>Robb looked hard at the dog. Then he laughed
and turned to Alice.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the creature&#8217;s name? I didn&#8217;t catch it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neche,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>Robb held out his hand encouragingly and called
the dog by name. The animal continued to squirm
but did not offer to come nearer. Every now and then
its head was turned back, and the green eyes looked
up into Prudence&#8217;s face. At last Robb ceased his
efforts. His blandishments were ineffectual beyond
increasing the dog&#8217;s effusive display.</p>
<p>&#8220;A husky,&#8221; he said, looking across at Prudence.
&#8220;A bad dog to have about the house. He reminds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
me of the animals we had up north in our dog-train.
They&#8217;re devils to handle and as fierce as wild cats.
We had one just like him. Unusually big brute. He
was our &#8216;wheeler.&#8217; The most vicious dog of the lot.
The resemblance is striking. By Jove!&#8221; he went on
reminiscently, &#8220;he was a sulky, cantankerous cuss.
His name was &#8216;Sitting Bull,&#8217; after the renowned Sioux
Indian chief. We had to be very careful of the other
dogs on account of his &#8216;scrapping&#8217; propensities. He
killed one poor beast I think we nicknamed him
rather appropriately. He was affectionately dubbed
&#8216;Bully.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>As Robb pronounced the name he held out his
hand again and flicked his fingers. The dog rose
from his grovelling posture and came eagerly forward,
wagging his lank tail. He rubbed his nose against
the man&#8217;s hand and slowly licked the sun-tanned skin.</p>
<p>Robb&#8217;s brows drew together in a pucker of deep
perplexity. He looked the animal over long and
earnestly, and slowly there crept into his eyes an
expression of wondering astonishment. He was interrupted
in his inspection by the girl at his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, he&#8217;s treating you like an old friend, Robb.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man sat gazing down upon the wiry coat of
the beast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said shortly. Then he looked over at
Prudence. &#8220;Yours?&#8221; he went on.</p>
<p>The girl shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he belongs to Hervey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um! I wonder where he got him from,&#8221; in a
meditative tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somewhere out in the wilds of the Yukon,&#8221; put in
Alice.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Ah! The Yukon.&#8221; And Robb&#8217;s face was serious
as he turned towards the window and looked out at
the creeping shadows of evening.</p>
<p>There was a pause. Prudence was thinking of anything
but the subject of Robb&#8217;s inquiries. Alice was
curious, but she forbore to question. She had heard
her lover&#8217;s account of his misadventure in the Alaskan
hills, but she saw no connection between the hound
and that disastrous affair. But the man&#8217;s thoughts
were hard at work. Presently he rose to depart.</p>
<p>He bade Prudence good-bye and moved towards
the door. The dog remained where he had been
standing and looked after him. At the door Robb
hesitated, then he turned and looked back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor old Bully,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>With a bound the dog was at his side. Then the
man turned away, and, accompanied by Alice, left the
room. In the passage he paused, and Alice saw an
expression on his face she had never seen before. He
was nervous and excited, and his eyes shone in the
half-light.</p>
<p>&#8220;Al,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;I know that dog. <i>And his
name is Bully</i>. Don&#8217;t say anything to anybody.
Hervey may be able to tell me something of those
who robbed us up in the hills. But on no account
must you say anything to him; leave it to me. I
shall come here again&ndash;&ndash;soon. Good-bye, little woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>That evening as Robb Chillingwood rode back to
Ainsley he thought of many things, but chiefly he
reviewed the details of that last disastrous journey
when he and Grey had traversed the snow-fields of
Alaska together.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE LAST OF LONELY RANCH</h3>
</div>
<p>There are moments which come in all lives when
calm reflection is powerless to influence the individual
acts; when calmness, even in the most phlegmatic
natures, is impossible; when a tide of impulse sweeps
us on, giving us not even so much as a breathless,
momentary pause in which to consider the result of
our headlong career. We blunder on against every
jagged obstacle, lacerated and bleeding, jolting cruelly
from point to point, whither our passions irresistibly
drive us. It is a blind, reckless journey, from which
there is no escape when the tide sets in. We see our
goal ahead, and we fondly believe that because it is
ahead we must come to it. We do not consider the
awful road we travel, nor the gradual exhaustion
which is overtaking us. We do not realize that we
must fall by the wayside for lack of strength, nor
even, if our strength be sufficient to carry us on to the
end, do we ask ourselves, shall we be able to draw
aside out of the raging torrent when our goal is
reached? or shall we be swept on to the yawning
Beyond where, for evermore, we must continue to
struggle hopelessly to return? Once give passion
unchecked sway, and who can say what the end will be?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></div>
<p>It was at such a moment in her life at which
Prudence had arrived. Her mind was set upon an
object which absorbed all her faculties, all her brain,
all her feelings. Had she been able to pause, even
for one moment, reason must have asserted itself and
she would have understood the folly of what she was
doing. But that moment was denied her. All the
latent passions of a strong nature had been let loose
and she was swept on by their irresistible tide. She
believed that she was the appointed avenger of the
man she had once loved, and that this duty unfulfilled
would be a crime, the stain of which nothing could
wipe out. Iredale must be confronted, challenged,
and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>And so she came to Lonely Ranch on her self-imposed
errand of justice.</p>
<p>The man she sought was not in the house when she
came. The valley seemed to be devoid of life as
she rode up. But the solitude was almost instantly
broken by the appearance of Chintz from the region
of the barn. She dispatched him in search of his
master and passed into the bachelor sitting-room to
await his coming.</p>
<p>She was restless and her nerves were strung to a
great tension. Her eyes still shone with that peculiar
light which ever seemed to look out of her brother&#8217;s.
There was no yielding in the set of her mouth.
Her resolve disfigured the sweetness which usually
characterized her beautiful features.</p>
<p>She stood before the window, looking out upon the
shadow-bathed valley. She saw before her the dark
wall of foliage which rose to the heights of the Front
Hill. Not a living soul was about, only was there a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
rising wind which disturbed the unbroken forest of
pines. She turned abruptly from the view as though
she could not bear the solitude which was thus
made so apparent. She crossed over to where the
bookcase stood against the wall, and glanced in
through the glazed doors. But she comprehended
nothing of what she saw. She was thinking, thinking,
and her mind was in a tumult of hysterical fancies.
And she was listening too; listening for a sound&ndash;&ndash;any
sound other than that which the wind made.
Mechanically she came over to the table and leant
against it in an attitude of abstraction. She shivered;
she stood up to steady herself and she shivered again.
And all the time the frenzied eyes gleamed in their
beautiful oval setting, the lips were drawn inwards,
and there remained only a sharply-defined line to
mark the sweet mouth. Presently her lips parted and
she moistened them with her tongue. A fever seemed
to be upon her, and mouth and throat were parched.</p>
<p>Suddenly the sound for which she waited came.
She darted eagerly to the window and saw Chintz
pass round in the direction of the barn. Then she
saw the burly figure of the man she was awaiting
appear in the clearing fronting the house.</p>
<p>George Iredale came along at a robust gait. He
was clad in moleskin riding-breeches, much stained
with clay, as though he had been digging; a soft shirt,
the sleeves of which were rolled up above the elbow;
his Stetson hat was adjusted at the correct angle
upon his head; and he wore a pair of tan-coloured
field boots, much smeared with the signs of toil. He
came rapidly towards the house. There was nothing
furtive, nothing guilty about this man&#8217;s bearing; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
came readily to meet his visitor, and his appearance
was the confident bearing of a man who has little to
fear.</p>
<p>She saw him look towards the window where she
stood, and his smile of welcome set her nerves tingling
with a sensation she failed to understand. Her
hand went round to the pocket of her linen riding-skirt
and remained there. She heard his step in the
hall; she heard him approach and turn the door
handle. As he came into the room she faced him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Prudence, this is a delightful&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he began.
But she interrupted him coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;One moment,&#8221; she said, and her voice was hoarse
with the dryness of her throat. &#8220;I have not come
over for any visit of pleasure, but strictly upon a
matter of&ndash;&ndash;of&ndash;&ndash;business. There are some explanations
which we both need to make, but more
especially you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale was gazing earnestly into the face before
him. He was trying to fathom the meaning of her
coldness. For the moment he wondered; then,
slowly, he began to understand that Hervey had been
at work.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got my note,&#8221; he said, choosing to ignore the
result of his observations. &#8220;My delay in calling at
the farm was unavoidable. I am in the midst of
disposing of my ranch. I had not expected that I
should have been called upon to do so so soon. I
beg that you will forgive me what must seem an
unwarrantable delay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence&#8217;s nerves were so strung that she felt as
though she could strike him for his calm words. Her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
condition demanded the opposition of passion equal
to her own. His coolness maddened her. So long
had she dwelt upon the accusation Hervey had
brought against him that she believed in this man&#8217;s
guilt. The evidence of her own senses had militated
against him, and now she steeled herself in an armour
of unbelief. But, in spite of herself, the dictates of
her heart were struggling hard to find the joints of
her armour. Nor were the struggles lessened now
that she stood confronting him. His coolness, though
maddening to her, was not without effect. The
moral influence he wielded was great.</p>
<p>She backed to the table; then she plunged into
the subject of her mission without further preamble.
Her eyes stared straight into his, and her tones
sounded incisively in the stillness of the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I little knew the man whom I was listening to
when he offered me his life, nor had I an idea of
how near I was to the man who inspired the words
which have appeared in the paper&ndash;&ndash;the words which
were the last Leslie Grey ever uttered. What must
have been your feelings when I told you that I knew
their author to be a murderer?&#8221; Then, with scathing
bitterness: &#8220;But your feelings must have long since
been dead&ndash;&ndash;dead as the poor creature you so wantonly
sent to his reckoning. The time has come for
you to defend yourself; that is, if defence you can
offer. No flimsy excuse or extenuation will cover
you. Even the Scriptures teach us that the penalty
is &#8216;a life for a life.&#8217; Yours is the hand that struck
Leslie down, and now you must face the consequences
of your wanton act.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale&#8217;s quiet eyes never attempted to avoid the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
girl&#8217;s direct gaze, nor did he flinch as the accusation
fell from her lips. Never was he more alert, never
more gently disposed towards this half-demented
creature than at that moment. He recognized the
hand that had been at work, and he laid no blame
upon her. His feelings were of sorrow&ndash;&ndash;sorrow for
the woman he loved, and sorrow for himself. But his
thoughts were chiefly for her. He knew, as she had
said, that his time had come.</p>
<p>&#8220;So Hervey has been to you to sell the discovery
which I rejected at the price he asked. He told you
that I was a smuggler; that the announcement in the
paper was mine. And did he tell you that I was the
murderer of Leslie Grey? Or did your heart prompt
you to that conclusion?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl supported herself against the table with
one hand, and the other was still in the pocket behind
her. Iredale noted these things without moving his
eyes from her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hervey told me the facts and the inevitable proof
they bore. Nor was his statement exaggerated. My
own reason told me that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man sighed. He had hoped that the work
had been only of the brother&#8217;s doings. He had
hoped that she had come bearing Hervey&#8217;s accusation
and not her own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you for what you really are, George
Iredale. And now I have come to you to give you
the chance of defending yourself. No man must be
condemned without a hearing. Neither shall you.
The evidence against you is overwhelming; I can see
no escape for you. But speak, if you have anything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
to say in your defence, and I will listen. I charge
you with the murder of Leslie Grey.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just for one brief moment Iredale felt a shiver pass
through his body. The icy tones of the girl&#8217;s voice,
the seemingly dispassionate words filled him with a
horror unspeakable. Then he pulled himself together.
He was on his defence before the one person in the
world from whose condemnation he shrank. He did
not answer at once. He wished to make no mistake.
When at last he spoke his words came slowly as
though he weighed well each syllable before he gave
it utterance.</p>
<p>&#8220;With one exception all that Hervey has doubtless
said of me is true. I am a smuggler; I inspired that
line in the paper; but I am no&ndash;&ndash;murderer. Leslie
Grey&#8217;s life was sacred to me at the time if only for
the reason that he was your affianced husband. I
loved you at that time as I have loved you for years,
and all my thoughts and wishes were for your happiness.
It would have made you happy to have married
Grey, therefore I wished that you should marry him.
I am quite unchanged. I will tell you now what
neither you nor Hervey knows, even though it makes
my case look blacker. I knew that Grey was on my
track. I knew that he had discovered my secret.
How he had done so I cannot say. He quarrelled
with me, and, in the heat of his anger, told me of his
intentions. It was late one night at a card-party at
your house, and just before he was so foully murdered.
No doubt you, or any right-minded person for that
matter, will say that this evidence only clinches the
case against me. But, in spite of it, I assert my
innocence. Amongst my many sins the crime Hervey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
charges me with&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he purposely avoided associating
the charge with her&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;is not numbered. Can I hope
that you will believe me?&#8221;</p>
<p>The gentle tones in which the burly man spoke, the
earnest fearlessness which looked out from his quiet
eyes, gave infinite weight to all he said. Prudence
shook her head slowly, but the fire in her eyes was
less bright, and the voice of her own heart crying out
began to make itself heard in the midst of her chaotic
thought.</p>
<p>She tried to stiffen herself for the task she had
undertaken, but the result was not all she sought
Still, she replied coldly&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I believe with all the black evidence
against you? You, in all this region, were the one
man interested in Leslie&#8217;s death. His life meant
penitentiary to you; his death meant liberty. Your
own words tell me that. How can I believe such a
denial as you now make? Tell me, have you no
proof to offer? Account for the day on which Leslie
met his death; prove your movements upon that
day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s denial of belief was belied by the eagerness
in her voice. For one brief instant a flash of
hope rose in her. She saw a loophole for her lover.
She longed to believe him. But the hope died down,
leaving her worse distracted for its coming.</p>
<p>For Iredale did not speak, and his face assumed a
look of gloom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you cannot&ndash;&ndash;you cannot,&#8221; she went on
hysterically. &#8220;I might have known, I did know.&#8221;
A world of passion again leapt into her eyes. Then
something of the woman broke through her anger,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
and a heart-breaking piteousness sounded in her
voice. &#8220;Oh, why, why did you do this thing? Why
did you stain your hands with such a crime as murder?
What would his living have meant to you? At worst
the penitentiary. Was it worth it to destroy thus the
last chance of your immortal soul? Oh, God! And
to think of it! A murderer!&#8221; Then the fierce anger
became dominant once more. &#8220;But you shall not
escape. Your crime shall be expiated as far as
human crimes can be expiated. The gallows awaits
you, George Iredale, and your story shall be told to
the world. You shall hang unless you can give to
judge and jury a better denial than you have given to
me.&#8221; She suddenly broke off. A whistling indrawn
breath startled the man before her. She gazed round
her wildly; she had remembered what she had come
for. She had forgotten when she had talked of
&#8220;judge and jury.&#8221; Her face assumed a ghastly hue
at the recollection. Her eyes alone still told of the
madness that possessed her.</p>
<p>Nor was Iredale without an uneasy feeling at what
he saw&ndash;&ndash;that catch of breath; that hunted look as
she gazed about the room. Intuition served him in
the moment of crisis. What was the meaning? Why
was that hand concealed in her dress? There was
only one possible answer to such questions, and he
read the answer aright.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prudence,&#8221; he said, in his deep musical voice,
whilst his keen eyes riveted her attention, &#8220;I can
prove my innocence of the crime you charge me with.
Listen to me patiently, and I will tell you how. Do
not let your anger drive you to any rash act which
might bring you&ndash;&ndash;lifelong regret.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></div>
<p>The girl made a sharp ejaculation. But she did
not attempt to interrupt him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can prove that I was not within three hundred
miles of this place on the day of Leslie&#8217;s death,&#8221; the
man went on. &#8220;That I was in a city to the west
of here distributing&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;bitterly&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;my wares. I can
prove all this&ndash;&ndash;to you. And I intend that before you
leave me to-day you shall be a witness to my innocence,
even against all prejudice. But before judge
and jury it will be different&ndash;&ndash;very different.&#8221; He
sighed. &#8220;There I cannot prove my innocence, for to
do so would be to betray my comrades&ndash;&ndash;those who
have traded with me and trusted me&ndash;&ndash;and send them
to the penal servitude which also awaits me.&#8221; His
eyes had become reflective. He seemed to be talking
to himself now rather than to the woman before him.
&#8220;No, I cannot save myself at such a cost. Even
to escape the gallows I will not play the part of
Judas.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman made no reply. She stood staring at
him with all that was best in her shining in her eyes.
She was trying to follow his every word and to take
his meaning, and the one thought which dominated
her whole mind was his expressed ability to prove his
innocence to her.</p>
<p>He seemed to awake from some melancholy reverie,
and again his eyes sought hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you wish me to prove my innocence?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; you must&ndash;&ndash;you shall!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl moved from the table; and, for the first
time during the interview, her hand was removed
from the pocket in her skirt. Hope filled the heart
in which but now the fires of hell had seemed to burn.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
She drank in his words with a soul-consuming thirst
The proof! That was what she required.</p>
<p>Iredale went on with grave gentleness.</p>
<p>&#8220;The proof is in here.&#8221; He moved to the bookcase
and opened a secret recess in the back of it,
&#8220;In this cupboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>He produced a pile of books and brought them to
the table. Picking out one he opened it at the date
of Grey&#8217;s death. It was a diary. He read out the
entries for the entire week, all of which bore out his
testimony. Every one was dated at a different town
or village, and related to his sales of opium. He then
opened another book and showed the entries of his
sales and the figures. He went through the whole
pile, book after book, and all of them bore out his
statement as to his whereabouts. Then he produced
several contracts; these were deeds between himself
and various traders, and were dated at the towns at
which they were signed. Each book and paper he
passed on to Prudence for her scrutiny, drawing her
attention to the corroboration in the evidence. There
could be no doubt as to the genuineness of these facts,
and the girl&#8217;s last shadowy doubts of his innocence
evaporated before the overwhelming detail. The
hope which had filled her heart was now replaced
by a triumphant joy. This man had shown her, had
convinced her, and she wanted nothing more at that
moment.</p>
<p>She looked up into his face, hoping to see a
reflection of her own happiness in it. But there
was no happiness there. His face was calm, but the
melancholy had deepened in his eyes. What she
saw came like an icy douche to her, and the happy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
expression died upon her lips. She suddenly remembered
that he had said he could not use this evidence
to publicly declare his innocence.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; she began.</p>
<p>He shook his head. He knew that she wished to
protest. For a moment they looked into each other&#8217;s
eyes. Then the woman, the weaker, broke down
under the strain. Tears came to her eyes, and she
poured out all the pent-up grief of her hours of misery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, George,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;can you ever forgive
my wickedness? I ought never to have believed.
My heart told me that you were innocent; but the
evidence&ndash;&ndash;oh, the evidence. I could see no loophole.
Everything pointed to you&ndash;&ndash;you. And I, wretch that
I am, I believed.&#8221; And the girl sobbed as though
her heart would break. Iredale made no attempt to
soothe her; he felt that it would be good for her to
weep. She leant against the table, and after a while
her sobs quietened. Then the man touched her upon
the shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry, Prue; my heart bleeds for you when I
listen to your sobs. You&#8217;re not to blame for believing
me guilty. Twelve jurymen will shortly do the same,
and who can blame them?&#8221; He shrugged. &#8220;I must
face the &#8216;music&#8217; and take my chance. And now, child,&#8221;
he added, his hand still resting upon her shoulder, and
smiling down upon her from his superior height, &#8220;give
me that which you have concealed in your pocket.
We will throw it away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence sprang up and moved beyond his reach.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! I can&#8217;t! Don&#8217;t ask me. Spare me the
shame of it. As you love me, George, don&#8217;t ask me
for it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></div>
<p>&#8220;As you will, dear; I merely wished to rid ourselves
of an ugly presence. While we are together&ndash;&ndash;and
it may not be for long now&ndash;&ndash;nothing should
come between us, least of all that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s tears had dried. She looked over at her
lover. His compelling influence was upon her. She
paused irresolute; then she plunged her hand into
her pocket and drew forth a large revolver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, take it. Take it, and do what you like
with it&#8221; Then she laughed bitterly. &#8220;You know
me as I am now. I brought that to shoot you with,
and afterwards to shoot myself. You see, I am a
murderess at heart.&#8221; And she smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>Iredale took the weapon and placed it in his bookcase.
Then he came to the girl&#8217;s side and put his
arm tenderly about her shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget it, child; forget it as you would a hideous
dream. Your feelings were forced upon you by&ndash;&ndash;well,
through my wretched doings. That which I
have done to gain wealth has brought only what
might have been expected in its train. No work of
evil is without its sting, and, as is always the case,
that sting seeks out the most sensitive part of its
victim. The chastisement for my wrongdoing has
been inflicted with cruel cunning, for you, Prue,
have been made to suffer; thus is my punishment a
hundredfold greater.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew her to him as he spoke, and gently
smoothed her dark hair. Under the influence of his
touch and the sound of his voice, the girl calmed.
She nestled close to his side, and for a moment
abandoned herself to the delight of being with him.
But her thoughts would not remain idle for long.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
Suddenly she released herself and moved to arm&#8217;s
length from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;George,&#8221; she said, in a tone of suppressed eagerness,
&#8220;they cannot try you for&ndash;&ndash;for murder. You
will tell them. You will show them all&ndash;&ndash;these. For
my sake, for the sake of all your friends, you will not
let them&ndash;&ndash;condemn you. Oh, you can&#8217;t allow it.
Think,&#8221; she went on, more passionately; &#8220;no men
would willingly let you be declared guilty when they
know you to be innocent. It must not be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale gave no outward sign. He had turned his
face away and was gazing in the direction of the
window. His reflective eyes looked out upon the
valley, but his resolve was written plainly in them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not tempt me, Prue,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;Were
I to do otherwise than I have resolved, and obtained
an acquittal thereby, I should live a life of utter
regret. I should despise myself; I should loathe my
own shadow. Nothing could be more revolting to
me than the man who plays the part of a traitor, and
were I that man life would be impossible to me.
Think of it only for one moment, sweetheart, and
your own good heart will tell you how impossible is
that which you ask me to do. It cannot be. All the
world would despise me. But even so, its utmost
execration would be nothing compared with my own
feelings at the thought that I had saved myself by
such methods.&#8221; He withdrew his hand from her
embrace. &#8220;No, when the time comes and I am
forced to stand my trial for Grey&#8217;s murder, I shall
face it. Nor shall I betray my friends by one single
word. And, too, when that time comes there will
not remain one single trace of the traffic which has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
hitherto been part of my very existence. There shall
be no possible chance of discovery for those who have
trusted me. Your brother Hervey will never hold
his hand. I know that. I realized that when he left
me after seeking &#8216;blackmail.&#8217; His vindictive nature
will see this through. And perhaps I would rather
have it so. It will then be settled once and for all.
I may get off, but I fear that it will be otherwise.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the mention of her brother&#8217;s name, Prudence
started, and the blood receded from her anxious face,
leaving it ghastly in its pallor. She had forgotten
that he was even now on his way to Winnipeg for the
express purpose of denouncing Iredale. For one
instant she shook like an aspen. Then she recovered
herself. What was to be done? She tried to think.
This matter of Hervey was of her doing. She had
driven him to it; urged him to it. Now she realized
the full horror of what her foolish credulity had led
her into. It had been in her power to stay his hand,
at least to draw his fangs. Now it was too late.
Suddenly she turned upon her lover in one final
appeal. At that moment it seemed the only chance
of saving him.</p>
<p>&#8220;George, there is a way out of it all; one last
resource if you will only listen to me. You love me
even in spite of the way I have wronged you. You
belong to me if only by reason of our love. You
have no right to throw your life away when you are
innocent. God knows I honour you for your decision
not to betray your companions. If it were possible, I
love you more than ever. But the sin would be as
great to throw your life away for such a shadow as it
would be to deliver your friends up to justice. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
can save yourself; you must. The border is near.
We are right on it. Surely the way you have brought
the Chinese into the country should provide an exit
for us. Oh, my poor love, will you not listen to me?
Will you not give me the life I crave? George, let
us go&ndash;&ndash;together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her words came passionately. She had stepped
forward and placed her two brown hands upon his
great shoulders, and her dark, earnest eyes gazed
lovingly up into his.</p>
<p>The temptation was a sore one, and the man found
it hard to resist. He experienced a sudden rush of
blood to the brain. His body seemed to be on fire.
He was pulsating with a mad passion. The thought
of what she suggested came near to overthrowing his
sternest resolve. To go with her. To have her evermore
by his side. The thought was maddening.
Surely he had never realized until that moment how
dearly he loved this woman. But his strong nature
came to his rescue in time. The passion had died
down as swiftly as it had risen and left him cold and
collected.</p>
<p>He gazed down into the brown eyes ever so kindly,
ever so lovingly; and his answer came in a tone so
gentle that the girl felt that whatever the future might
hold for them, this moment had been worth living for.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, sweetheart. Not flight, even though you
would be my companion. We love one another
dearly, and for that very fact I could never allow
myself to remain under this cloud. At all costs we
will have the matter cleared. I owe it to you, to those
at the farm, and to myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s hands dropped to her sides and she turned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
away. Then all the agony of her soul found vent in
one exclamation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, God!&#8221; she cried. And with that last cry
came the revealing flash which answered the question
she had so repeatedly asked herself. She turned back
to her lover, and the agonized expression of her face
had changed, and in her eyes was the eager light of
excitement. Iredale saw the change, but did not
recognize its meaning. He felt that she must no
longer remain there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Child, I want you to go back to the farm and tell
them of the accusation that has been brought against
me. Tell them all the circumstances of it. Tell them
that I have clearly convinced you of my innocence;
but, as you love me, I charge you not to reveal the
manner in which it was done. Tell your mother that
I shall come over to-morrow, and she shall hear the
whole story from my own lips. I wish to do this
that she may hear my version before she reads of
what must happen in the papers. After that I shall
go into Winnipeg and set the law in motion. I will
clear myself or&ndash;&ndash;otherwise. But on your honour you
must promise that all I have shown you to-day remains
a secret between us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence listened intently to all he said, but a quiet
look of resolve slowly crept into her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise,&#8221; she said, and Iredale thanked her with
a look.</p>
<p>There was the briefest of pauses; then she went on&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;On one condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale looked his surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you must hear me, George,&#8221; she went on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
eagerly. &#8220;You have charged me with this thing.
You must abide by my time. A day more or less
can make little difference to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I wish to give myself up before others can
make the charge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so. And in the meantime I want your
promise not to come to the farm until the&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;she
paused to make a swift mental calculation&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;day after
to-morrow at four o&#8217;clock in the afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me your reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is my own.&#8221; The girl was smiling now.
Then she again became excited. &#8220;Promise, promise,
promise! There is no time to lose. Even now I
fear we are too late.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale looked dubiously at her. Suddenly he saw
her face darken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Promise!&#8221; she demanded almost fiercely, &#8220;or I
will not abide by my promise to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>An expression of relief came into Prudence&#8217;s eyes, and
she stepped towards him and looked up into his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, George, dearest.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man suddenly clasped her in a bear-like
embrace and rained passionate, burning kisses on
her upturned lips. Then quietly she released herself.
She stood away from him holding one of his great
hands in both of hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick! Now my horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iredale departed, and Prudence was left alone. She
stood looking after him thinking, thinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I do it?&#8221; she asked herself.</p>
<p>Damside City was the nearest telegraph station.
It lay nearly thirty-five miles due west of Owl Hoot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
It was merely a grain station for the district and in
no sense a village. She must make that point and so
intercept Hervey with a telegraphic message. It was
her one chance. In spite of her lover she would buy
Hervey&#8217;s silence, and trust to the future to set the
rest straight. She was strong and her horse was
good. She must reach the office before it was closed
at six o&#8217;clock that evening. She calculated it up;
she had just three hours in which to cover the distance.
She looked out of the window. The wind
was blowing from the east; that was good, it would
ease the horse. She looked up at the sky, there were
a few clouds scudding westwards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; she said at last, &#8220;if it kills poor
Kitty.&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment later Iredale returned with the mare.
The girl waited not a second. Her lover assisted her
into the saddle reluctantly. He did not approve this
sudden activity on the part of the girl. When she
had settled herself she bent down, and their lips met
in one long, passionate kiss.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, George.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man waved his adieu. His heart was too full
to speak. She swung her mare round and galloped
down the valley to the north. Her object was to
clear the valley and then turn off to the west on the
almost disused trail to Damside.</p>
<p>Iredale looked after her until the sound of the
mare&#8217;s hoofs died away in the distance. He was
filled with wonder at her strange request and her
hurried departure. But his speculations brought him
to no definite conclusions, and he turned abruptly and
called to his man, Chintz.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></div>
<p>The man hurried from the stable.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been a little delayed. Is everything
ready?&#8221; Iredale looked up at the sky, then down
at the grizzled face before him.</p>
<p>Chintz nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. Then get to work. Start the first fire
directly beyond the graveyard to the east. The wind
is getting up steadily. You are sure there are no
farms to the west of us, between here and Rosy
River?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man gave a negative shake of the head.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right then. There will be no damage
done. And the river will cut the fire off. This time
to-morrow we shall be homeless wanderers, Chintz&ndash;&ndash;you
and I.&#8221; And the smuggler laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>Then his laugh died out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, to work. Set the fires going.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE FOREST DEMON PURSUES</h3>
</div>
<p>Prudence swung her mare out on to the overgrown
trail to Damside City. Kitty was a trim-built
little &#8220;broncho,&#8221; compact, well-ribbed, and with
powerful shoulders and chest. She was just the animal
to &#8220;stay&#8221; and travel fast. The road cut through the
heart of the Owl Hoot bush, and ran in a diagonal
direction, south-west towards the border. Then it
converged with the border trail which skirted the
great southern muskeg, and, passing through a broken,
stony country, went on to Damside.</p>
<p>The wind was rapidly freshening, and the scudding
clouds were quickly changing from white to grey,
which, to the girl&#8217;s practised mind, indicated an
immediate change of weather. But she thought little
of the matter beyond being thankful that the wind
was well behind her, she wished to travel fast, and a
&#8220;fair&#8221; wind is as necessary to the horseman, under
such circumstances, as it is to the mariner.</p>
<p>For a time the roughness of the road required her
attention. Kitty was surefooted, but the outstanding
roots with which her path was lined needed careful
negotiation. Presently the trail became wider and its
surface more even, and signs of recent usage became
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
apparent. The roots were worn down and the projecting
stones had been removed. Neither did it take
the girl long to decide whose servants had done these
things. On this obscure trail were to be seen many
signs of the traffic upon which the owner of Lonely
Ranch had been engaged. Now Prudence gave
Kitty her head, and the mare travelled at a great
pace.</p>
<p>The breeze had chastened the laden air of the pine
world. The redolent woods no longer scented the
air, which had in consequence become fresh and
bracing. For the moment the emergency of her
journey had dulled the girl&#8217;s sensibilities to her surroundings.
She looked out upon the beautiful tinted
world, but she heeded nothing of what her eyes
beheld. Her mind was set upon the object of her
journey, and her thoughts were centred round the
players in the drama of her life.</p>
<p>How different her life seemed to have suddenly
become from that which she had contemplated that
morning. A great triumphant joy was with her since
her lover had established his innocence to her. Her
troubles and anxieties were still many, and the least
thing might upset every hope she entertained, but
there was always with her the remembrance that
George Iredale was innocent, and in that thought she
felt a wonderful security. That he was a smuggler
was a matter of insignificance. She loved him too
well to let such knowledge narrow her estimation of
him. She was too essentially of the prairie to consider
so trifling a matter. Half the farmers in the
country were in the habit of breaking the Customs
regulations by cutting wood and hay on Government
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
lands without a permit, and even hauling these things
from across the border when such a course suited
them, and in every case it was &#8220;contraband&#8221;; but
they were thought no less of by their friends. Iredale
was no worse than they, in spite of the fact that his
offence carried with it a vastly heavier sentence.</p>
<p>But for the dread that she might be too late to
intercept her brother, Prudence would almost have
been happy as she raced along that westward-bound
trail. She knew her brother&#8217;s nature well. She knew
that he was vindictive, and no doubt her own treatment
of him had roused his ire and all the lower
instincts of his malignant nature; but she also knew
that he loved money&ndash;&ndash;needed money. His greed for
gold was a gluttonous madness which he was incapable
of resisting, and he would sacrifice any personal
feeling provided the inducement were sufficiently
large. She meant that the inducement should be as
large as even he could wish, and she knew that in this
direction his ideas were extensive. Her one trouble,
the one thought which alarmed her, was the question
of time. If the office were closed when she arrived,
her journey would have been in vain, for the operator
lived in Ainsley and would have gone home; Hervey
would have arrived in Winnipeg, and, by the time the
office opened the following morning, the mischief
would have been done.</p>
<p>She flicked her mare with the end of her reins and
touched her flank with her heel. Kitty responded
with a forward bound. The increased speed was all
too slow for the rapid thought and deadly anxiety of
the girl, but she was too good a horsewoman to press
the willing beast beyond a rational gait.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></div>
<p>The hardy mare &#8220;propped&#8221; jerkily as she passed
down the sharp side of a dried-out slough. She
plunged through a thicket of long grass, and a grey
cloud of mosquitoes rose and enveloped horse and
rider. The vicious insects settled like a grey cloth
upon the heated mare, and Prudence&#8217;s soft flesh was
punctured by hundreds of venomous needles at once.
The girl swept the insects from neck and face, heedless
of the torturing stings. The mare fretted and raced
up the opposite slope, while the girl leant forward in
her saddle and sought to relieve the staunch little
creature&#8217;s agony by sweeping the poisonous insects
from her steaming coat.</p>
<p>The mare pressed on. Suddenly she threw up her
head and snorted violently. Prudence was startled.
Something had distracted Kitty&#8217;s attention, and her
wide-set ears were cocked in alarm. Her nose was
held high, and again and again she snorted. In
consequence her pace was slackened and became
awkward. She no longer kept a straight line along
the trail, but moved from side to side in evident agitation.
Prudence was puzzled and endeavoured to
steady the creature. But Kitty was not to be easily
appeased. She rattled her bit and mouthed it
determinedly, grabbing at the side-bar with an evident
desire to secure it in her teeth. The girl kept a tight
rein and attempted to soothe her with the tender caress
of her hand; but her efforts were unavailing. The
ears were now turned backwards, and had assumed
that curiously vicious inclination which in a horse is
indicative of bad temper or equine terror. Kitty had
no vice in her, and Prudence quickly understood the
nature of her mare&#8217;s feelings.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></div>
<p>The failure of her soothing efforts alarmed the girl.
She sat up and looked about her. In the dense forest
there seemed to be no unusual appearance. The trees
were waving and bending in the wind, and their
groanings had a sadly mournful effect, upon the scene,
but otherwise there was nothing strange to be
observed. The sky had assumed a leaden hue, and
in this direction the prospect was not alluring, but
the clouds were fairly high and there was no suggestion
of immediate storm.</p>
<p>Suddenly a couple of jack-rabbits darted across the
road. The mare &#8220;propped,&#8221; reared, and swung round
towards the trees. Prudence brought her up to her
work sharply. Then she saw that the rabbits were
racing on ahead, down the trail. For the moment her
patience gave way, and she dug her heel hard against
Kitty&#8217;s side and the mare plunged forward. But her
gait remained unsteady, and in her agitation she kept
changing her stride, and once even tripped and nearly
fell.</p>
<p>A coyote followed by his mate and two young ones
ran out on to the trail and raced along ahead of her.
They did not even turn their heads to look at her.
Further on a great timber-wolf appeared and trotted
along the edge of the woods, every now and then
turning its head furtively to glance back.</p>
<p>Then quite suddenly Prudence became conscious of
something unusual. She raised her face to the grey
vault of the sky and sniffed at the air. A pungent
scent was borne upon the wind. The odour of
resinous wood, so strong as to be sickly, came to her,
and its pungency was not the ordinary scent of the
forest about her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span></div>
<p>Half-a-dozen kit-foxes dashed out on to the trail
and joined in the race, and the &#8220;yowl&#8221; of the prairie
dog warned her that other animals were about.
The resinous odour grew stronger every moment, and
at last Prudence detected the smell of smoke. She
turned her head and looked back; and behind her,
directly in her wake, she saw a thin grey haze which
the wind was sweeping along above the trees.</p>
<p>She drew her mare up to a stand, and as she sat
looking back, a deadly fear crept into her eyes. Kitty
resented the delay and reared and plunged in protest
The restraint maddened her. And all the time the
girl saw that the smoke haze was thickening, and some
strange distant sounds like the discharge of heavy
ordnance reached her.</p>
<p>The sweet oval face wore a strained expression;
her eyes were wide open and staring, and the fear
which looked out of them was fear of no ordinary
danger. She watched the dull haze as it thickened
and rolled on towards her. She saw it rise like great
steam-jets and wreath itself upwards as fresh volumes
displayed the lower strata. She saw the dull brown
tint creep into it as it densified, and she knew that <i>it
was smoke</i>. The rest needed no explanation beyond
the evidence of her senses. The sickly resinous smell
told her what had happened. The forest was on fire!</p>
<p>The thought found vent in a muttered exclamation.
Then came an afterthought&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the wind is blowing it straight along behind
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment she gazed about her wildly. She
looked to the right and left The forest walls were
impassable. She looked back along the trail. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
narrow ribbon-like space was filled with a fog of smoke
which was even now enveloping her. What should she
do? There was nothing for it but to go on. But the fire
must be travelling apace in the high wind. Still she
stood. It seemed as though for the moment her
faculties were paralyzed with the horror of her
discovery.</p>
<p>But at last she was moved to action. The mare
became troublesome. The girl could no longer keep her
still. The distracted animal humped her back and
began to show signs of &#8220;bucking.&#8221; Then came a rush
of animals along the trail; they came racing for dear
life, and their numbers were augmented from the
wooded depths which lined their route.</p>
<p>Antelope led the way; with heads thrown up and
antlers pressed low down upon their backs they
seemed to fly over the sandy soil. Then came the
&#8220;loping&#8221; dogs, coyotes, prairie wolves. Birds of all
sorts assembled in one long continuous flight. The
animal kingdom of that region of forest seemed to
have become united in their mutual terror&ndash;&ndash;wolf and
hare, coyote and jack-rabbit, hawks and blackbird,
prairie chicken and grey-owl; all sworn enemies in
time of calm prosperity, but now, in their terror,
companions to the last. And all the time, in the
growing twilight of smoke, came the distant booming
as of the discharge of great cannon.</p>
<p>The girl leaned forward. She clapped her heel
hard against the mare&#8217;s side, and with a silent prayer
joined in the race for life.</p>
<p>She had no exact knowledge of how far these woods
extended, or where the break would come which should
cut off the fire. The wild beasts were speeding on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
down the trail, and, with the instinct of her prairie
world, she reasoned that in this direction alone must lie
safety.</p>
<p>The smoke grew denser and more choking. Her
eyes became sore. Under her she felt the mare
stretching herself to the utmost of her gait. She
came up with many of the racing denizens of the
forest, but they did not attempt to move off the
trail at her approach. They were beyond the fear of
human presence. A more terrible enemy was behind
them, pursuing with gigantic strides which demolished
space with incredible swiftness.</p>
<p>Every moment the air grew hotter in spite of the
mare&#8217;s best efforts, and Prudence knew that the fire
was gaining. Hill or dale made no difference now.
It must be on&ndash;&ndash;on, or the devouring monster would
be upon them. Kitty never flagged, and with increasing
speed her footing became even more sure. A
loose line, with body bent well forward to ease the
animal, Prudence did all she knew to assist her willing
companion; but for every stride the faithful mare
took, she knew that the fire was gaining many yards.</p>
<p>The booming had increased to a steady roar, in the
midst of which the deep, thunderous detonations came
like the peals of a raging storm; the wind rushed
headlong forward, the fire bringing with it an almost
cyclonic sweep of heated air. The mighty forest
giants about her bent like reeds under the terrible
force, and shrieked aloud their fears at the coming
of the devouring demon.</p>
<p>The mare rushed down into a wide hollow. A
culvert bridged a reedy slough. The affrighted beast
raced across it. The stream of the animal world
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
swept on about her. She breasted the steep ascent
opposite, and Prudence was forced to draw rein.
She dared not allow the horse to race up such an
incline, even though the fire were within a quarter
of a mile of her; she would have been mad to exhaust
the faithful creature, which was now her only hope.
Even the poor forest creatures, mad as they were with
terror, slackened their gait.</p>
<p>At length the hilltop was gained, and a long descent
confronted them. Kitty showed no signs of exhaustion
yet, and faced her work amidst the rush of refugees
with all her original zest. Down into the valley they
tore, for the worst of all perils was in pursuit.</p>
<p>The valley stretched away far into the distance;
ahead, here, in this hollow, the air was clearer. The
hill had shut off the fog of smoke for the moment
The refugees now had a smooth run, and a faint
glimmer of hope gladdened the heart of the girl.</p>
<p>Without slackening her speed, she looked back at
the hill, fearing to see the ruthless flames dart up over
the path which her mare&#8217;s feet had so recently trodden.
But the flames had not yet reached the brow, and she
sighed her satisfaction. The smoke was pouring over
the tree-tops, and, circling and rolling in a tangled
mass, was creeping down in her wake, but as yet there
were no flames. She looked this way and that at the
dark green of the endless woods, the gracious fields
of bending pines. She thought of the beauty which
must so soon pass away, leaving behind it only the
charred skeletons, the barren, leafless trunks, which
for years would remain to mark the cruel path of
flame.</p>
<p>Suddenly the roar, which had partly died away into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
a vague distant murmur beyond the hill, burst out
again with redoubled fury. Again she looked round,
and the meaning was made plain to her. She saw the
yellow fringe of flame as it came dancing, chaotic, a
tattered ribbon of light upon the brow of the hill; she
saw the dense pall of smoke hovering high above it
like the threat of some dreadful doom. The black of
the forest upon the summit remained for a second,
then over swept the red-gold fire, absorbing all, devouring
all, in an almost torrential rush down to the woods
below.</p>
<p>And now she beheld a sea of living fire as the hills
blazed before her eyes. It was as though the whole
place had been lit at one touch. The sea rolled on
with incredible swiftness, as the tongues of flame licked
up the inflammable objects they encountered. The
efforts of her mare became puerile in comparison with
the fearful pace of the flames. How could she hope
to outstrip such awful speed?</p>
<p>On, on raced the mare, and on came the molten
torrent. Now the heat was intolerable. The girl leant
limply over her faithful horse&#8217;s neck; she was dizzy
and confused. Every blast of the wind burnt her more
fiercely as the fire drew nearer. She felt how utterly
hopeless were her horse&#8217;s efforts.</p>
<p>The mare faltered in her stride; it was her first
trip. The girl shrieked wildly. She screamed at the
top of her voice like one demented. Her nerves were
failing, and hysteria gripped her. Kitty redoubled
her efforts. The fear of the fire was aggravated by
the girl&#8217;s wild cries, and she stretched herself as she
had never done before.</p>
<p>Now it seemed as though they were racing in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
heart of a furnace. The whole country was in flames,
and the roar and crashing of falling timber was incessant,
and the yellow glow was everywhere&ndash;&ndash;even
ahead.</p>
<p>Blinded, dazed, the girl was borne on by the faithful
Kitty. She no longer thought of what was so near
behind her. What little reason was left to her she
centred upon keeping her seat in the saddle. An
awful faintness was upon her, and everything about
her seemed distant.</p>
<p>Kitty alone fought out the battle of that ride; her
mistress was beyond all but keeping upon the faithful
animal&#8217;s back. Had she been less exhausted, the girl
would have seen what the mare saw. She would have
seen the broad stream of the Rosy river ahead, and
less than a quarter of a mile away. But she saw
nothing; she felt nothing; she cared for nothing but
her hold upon the saddle. Thus it was that when she
came to the riverside, and the mare plunged from the
steep bank into the deep, quick-flowing stream, she
knew not what had happened, but, with a strange
tenacity, she held to the pummels of her saddle, while
her loyal friend breasted the waters.</p>
<p>How they got out of the river Prudence never knew,
nor did she fully realize all that had happened when
at last the horse and rider again stood on firm ground.
And the tough little broncho had covered another
mile or more before the girl awoke to the fact that
they were now in an open prairie country, and skirting
the brink of the great southern muskeg. Then it all
came back to her, and, as Kitty kept steadily on, she
looked fearfully about her. She saw away in the
distance the awful pall, the lurid gleam of the flames;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
and a heartfelt prayer of thanksgiving went up from
that lonely trail for the merciful escape which had
been hers. The girl leant over her mare&#8217;s shoulder
and caressed the foaming neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Kitty, faithful little mare,&#8221; she exclaimed
emotionally. Then she looked ahead and she remembered
all. &#8220;But on, girl, on. There is more
to do yet.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The telegraph operator at Damside was closing
up his little shack. He had just disconnected his
instrument and was standing in his doorway gazing
out across the prairie to the east, watching the vast
clouds of smoke belching from the direction of the
woods. All about him was a heavy haze, and a
nasty taste of smoke was in his mouth. He looked
across to the only other buildings which formed the
city of Damside, the grain elevator and the railway
siding buildings. His own hut was close beside the
latter. The men were leaving their work. Then
presently he looked back in the direction of the
distant fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t the prairie,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Too thick.
Guess the woods are blazin&#8217;. That&#8217;s beyond the Rosy.
Can&#8217;t cross there, so I reckon there&#8217;s no danger to
us. The air do stink here; guess I&#8217;ll go and git
my hand-car and vamoose.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned back to the room and put on his hat.
Just as he left his doorway to pass over to where his
hand-car was standing on the railway track, he brought
up to a halt A horse and rider were racing up the
trail towards him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, what&#8217;s this?&#8221; he exclaimed sharply.
&#8220;Maybe it <i>is</i> the prairie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence drew rein beside him. She had seen her
man, and she knew that she was in time. Her joy
was written in her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;My, but I&#8217;ve had a time,&#8221; she exclaimed, as she
slid down from her saddle. &#8220;I thought that fire had
got me. Call up Winnipeg, please, Mr. Frances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Miss Mailing, have you ridden through
that?&#8221; asked the operator, pointing to the distant
smoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not through it, but with it distinctly hot upon my
heels&ndash;&ndash;or rather my mare&#8217;s,&#8221; the girl laughed. &#8220;But
I want you to send a message for me. It isn&#8217;t too
late for Winnipeg?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Late, bless you, no. But what is it? Prairie or
forest?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forest,&#8221; replied the girl shortly. &#8220;Where&#8217;s a
form?&#8221;</p>
<p>They passed into the hut. Prudence proceeded to
write out her message while the man connected up
Winnipeg and carried on a short conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bad fire,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence began to write.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Owl Hoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;River&#8217;ll stop it&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence went on writing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Iredale&#8217;s ranch burnt out?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl started.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Must be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Then: &#8220;Here you are; and do you mind
if I wait for an answer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pleasure.&#8221; And the man read the message&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class='lalign'>&#8220;To Hervey Malling, Northern Union Hotel,<br />
Winnipeg.</p>
<p>&#8220;Return at once. Money awaiting you. Willing
to pay the price on your arrival. Do not fail to return
at once. The other matter can rest.</p>
<p class='ralign'>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Prudence</span>.&#8221;<span class='rindent2'>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The operator tapped away at the instrument.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Hervey was sitting in the Northern Union Hotel
smoking-room. He was talking to a burly man, with
a red face and a shock of ginger-grey hair. This was
the proprietor of the hotel.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long can you give me? I can settle everything
by this day month. The harvesting is just
finished. I only need time to haul the grain to the
elevator. Will that satisfy you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The big man shrugged.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve put me off so often, Mr. Malling. It&#8217;s not
business, and you know it,&#8221; he replied gutturally.
&#8220;Will you give me an order on&ndash;&ndash;your crop?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked squarely into the other&#8217;s face. Hervey
hesitated. He knew that he could not do this, and
yet he was sorely pressed for money. However, he
made up his mind to take the risk. He thought his
mother would not go back on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span></div>
<p>He turned as the bell-boy approached.</p>
<p>&#8220;Telegram for you, sir; &#8216;expressed.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Hervey took the envelope and tore it open. He
read his sister&#8217;s message, and a world of relief and
triumph lit up his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; he muttered. Then he passed it to his
companion. &#8220;Read that. Do you still need a
mortgage? I shall set out to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hotel proprietor read the message, and a
satisfied smile spread over his face. It did not do
for him to press his customers too hard. But still
he was a business man. He, too, felt relieved.</p>
<p>&#8220;This relates to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An ouylying farm of mine which I have now sold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your promise will be sufficient, Mr. Malling. I
thought we should find an amicable settlement for our
difficulty. You start to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>THE AVENGER</h3>
</div>
<p>Alice was standing at the gate of the little front
garden. She was talking to her lover, who had just
ridden up from the direction of Owl Hoot. Robb
had not dismounted, and his face was very serious
as he leant down towards her.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I never knew a word about it. It&#8217;s a jolly
good thing I obtained the delivery of his bunch of
cattle when I did, or goodness knows what would
have happened. Well, anyhow I&#8217;ve lost a nice lump.
My client, when he heard about the place being for
sale, wanted to buy it for a back country for his
beeves to winter in. Just my confounded luck. I knew
there was a big fire out this way, but I never thought
that Iredale was the unfortunate victim. Now I&#8217;ve
got to go over to Lakeville to see him&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s staying
there, you know, since he was burnt out. I&#8217;ll come
back this way, and if Mrs Malling can put me up
for the night, I&#8217;ll be grateful. My &#8216;plug&#8217; won&#8217;t stand
the journey back home. You say Hervey will be
along this evening?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the girl Then seriously, &#8220;What
are you going to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Interview him. There are things about that dog
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
that want explaining. I take it he can explain &#8217;em.
I don&#8217;t easily forget. And I owe some one a deal
more than I&#8217;ve yet been able to pay. P&#8217;r&#8217;aps that
dog&#8217;ll help me to discharge my debt. Good-bye, Al;
I must be off or I shan&#8217;t get back this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robb turned away in his cheerful, debonair
manner and rode off. Troubles sat lightly on his
stout heart. His effervescent nature never left him
long depressed when Fortune played her freakish
tricks upon him. He had lost his commission upon
the sale of Iredale&#8217;s land, but he had secured the
better deal of the cattle. Therefore he was satisfied.
But Robb was a very persistent man in his seemingly
haphazard fashion. He had promised himself an
interview with Hervey about his dog. He had never
forgotten or forgiven the disaster in the mountains,
and he believed that Hervey would be able to set
him on the track of Zachary Smith, whom he felt
certain he had seen at the Winnipeg dep&ocirc;t. He
hoped so; and, for this purpose, he intended to spend
the night at Loon Dyke Farm.</p>
<p>As her lover rode away Alice turned back to the
house. The anxious look was still upon her face.
She knew that there was serious trouble in the family,
and she could see no way of helping these people she
loved. Prudence was in sad disgrace with her
mother; she had been absent from the farm for
two days and had only returned that morning. Mrs.
Malling had been distracted with anxiety and grief
until the re-appearance of her daughter, and then,
when she saw that she was well and that no accident
had happened to her, she had flown into such a
terrible passion that even Prudence had quailed before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
her. Never in her life had Alice seen the kindly
old soul give way to such rage. No disparaging
epithet had been too bad for her child, and she had
literally chased the girl from the room in which they
had met. Since then Prudence had retreated to her
bedroom, and Hephzibah had poured out the vials
of her wrath upon an empty kitchen, for even the
long-suffering hired girl had feared to face her.</p>
<p>Now, as Alice approached the front door again,
she heard the sound of high-pitched voices coming
from the kitchen. Sarah Gurridge had come over
while the farm-wife&#8217;s rage was at its height; and, as
Alice listened, she thought that these two old cronies
were quarrelling. But her ears quickly told her that
her surmise was wrong. She heard Prudence&#8217;s voice
raised in angry protest, and, instead of entering the
house, she discreetly withdrew, passing round to the
farmyard instead.</p>
<p>In the kitchen a stormy scene was being enacted.</p>
<p>Prudence was standing just inside the door. Her
mother was beside a long table on which were laid
out the necessaries for pastry-making. She had
faced round upon the girl and stood brandishing a
rolling-pin in one hand, and in the other she held
a small basket of eggs. Sarah was seated in a high-backed
Windsor chair. Her arms were folded across
her waist, and her face expressed perplexed alarm.
Prudence&#8217;s face was aflame; nor were her eyes one
whit less angry than her mother&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I say you shall hear me, mother, whether
you like it or not. I&#8217;ll not let you or any one else
call me the filth which you did this morning for
nothing.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span></div>
<p>The girl&#8217;s voice was hoarse with nervous feeling,
Mrs Mailing shook her rolling-pin in a perfect fury.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of this kitchen, you baggage! Out of it, do
you hear me? Go an&#8217; get your garments packed up,
and out ye go into the street. Child o&#8217; my flesh, are
ye? Out of my house, you drab, or maybe I&#8217;ll be
doing you a harm. I&#8217;ll teach the like o&#8217; you to be
stoppin&#8217; out o&#8217; nights an&#8217; then to come back wi&#8217;out
a word of explainin&#8217;. I&#8217;ll teach you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give the child a hearing, Hephzibah,&#8221; said Sarah,
in her soft even tones, as there came a lull in the
angry mother&#8217;s tirade.</p>
<p>Prudence shot a grateful glance in her preceptor&#8217;s
direction.</p>
<p>Hephzibah turned swiftly on the peaceful Sarah.
But the words of anger which hovered upon her
lips remained unspoken. Sarah was an influence in
the old lady&#8217;s life, and long association was not
without effect. She visibly calmed. Prudence saw
the change and took advantage of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could I explain when you wouldn&#8217;t listen
to me?&#8221; she exclaimed resentfully. &#8220;Almost before
I could say a word you called me all the shameful
things you could think of. You drove me to silence
when I was willing to tell you all&ndash;&ndash;I was more than
willing. You <i>must</i> know all, for the story I have to
tell as nearly affects you as it does me. I stayed
away from home to save an innocent man from the
dreadful charge of murder, and your son from perpetrating
the most wanton act of his worthless life.&#8221;</p>
<p>A dead silence followed her words. Hephzibah
stared at her with an expression of stupefied amazement,
while Sarah turned in her chair with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
movement which was almost a jolt. The silence
was at last broken by the girl&#8217;s mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Murder? Hervey?&#8221;</p>
<p>And there was no understanding in her tone.
Her mind seemed to be groping blindly, and she
merely repeated the two words which struck her
most forcibly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, &#8216;murder&#8217; and &#8216;Hervey,&#8217;&#8221; Prudence retorted.
&#8220;Hervey has accused George Iredale of the murder
of Leslie Grey. Now will you listen to my
explanation?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hephzibah precipitated herself into a chair. The
rolling-pin was returned to its place upon the dough-board
with a clatter, and the basket of eggs was set
down with a force that sorely jeopardized its contents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, girl. Tell me all. Let me hear what devil&#8217;s
work my Hervey&#8217;s been up to. La sakes! an&#8217;
George Iredale a murderer!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Prudence, her anger evaporated as swiftly as
her mother&#8217;s, told the two old ladies of her love for
Iredale, and how he had asked her to be his wife.
She told them how Hervey had come to her with the
story of his discovery; how, after attempting to
blackmail his victim, he had offered his information to
her at a price. How she forced him to prove his
case, and had sent him to Winnipeg with that object;
how she had been nearly distracted, and eventually
made up her mind to go and see Iredale himself;
how the accused man had established to her his
innocence beyond any doubt, and how he had shown
her how impossible it would be for him to use the
same means of clearing himself in a court of law.
She dwelt upon each point, so that these two, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
were so dear to her, should not fail to understand as
she understood. Then she told them how, recognizing
George&#8217;s danger, she had resolved to intercept
Hervey, and, with her mother&#8217;s assistance, pay him
off; and, finally, how she had been overtaken by the
forest fire; and how, her mare exhausted, she had
arrived at Damside in time to send her message to
her brother; and how, failing any other means of
returning home, she had taken shelter with the
elevator clerk&#8217;s wife until her mare had recovered and
she was able to resume her journey to the farm.</p>
<p>It was a long story, and the many interruptions of
her mother gave the girl much extra trouble in the
telling; but with a wonderful patience, born of her
anxiety for her lover, she dealt with every little
point that puzzled her audience.</p>
<p>When the story was finished its effect was made
curiously manifest. The one thing which seemed to
have gripped her mother&#8217;s intensest feeling was the
part her boy had played. Her round eyes had grown
stern, and her comely lips had parted as her breath
came heavy and fast. At last she burst out with a
curious mixture of anger and sorrow in her words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bone of my Silas; flesh of my flesh; an&#8217; to think
o&#8217; the like. My Hervey a whelp of hell; a bloodsucker.
Oh, that I should ha&#8217; lived to see such a
day,&#8221; and she rocked herself, with her hand supporting
her head and her elbows planted upon her knees.
&#8220;Oh, them travellin&#8217;s in foreign parts. My poor,
poor Silas; if he&#8217;d jest lived long &#8217;nough to git around
our boy with a horsewhip we might ha&#8217; been spared
this disgrace. Prudence, girl, I&#8217;m that sorry for what
I&#8217;ve said to you.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span></div>
<p>Tears welled in the old eyes, which had now become
very wistful, and slowly rolled down the plump
cheeks. Suddenly she gathered up her apron and
flung it up over her head, and the rocking continued
dismally. Prudence came over to her and knelt at
her side, caressing her stout figure in sympathy.
Sarah sat looking away towards the window with
dreamy eyes. The old school-mistress made no
comment; she was thinking deeply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry, mother,&#8221; said Prudence, with an
ominous catch in her voice. &#8220;Whatever Hervey&#8217;s
faults, he will reap his own punishment. I want you
to help me now, dear. I want you to give me the
benefit of your experience and your sound, practical
sense. I must see this through. I have a wicked
brother and an obstinate lover to deal with, and I
want you to help me, and tell me what is best to
do.&#8221;</p>
<p>The apron was removed from Mrs. Malling&#8217;s head,
and her eyes, red and watery, looked at the girl at
her side with a world of love in their depths.</p>
<p>&#8220;These two men will be here this afternoon,&#8221; the
girl went on. &#8220;George is coming to tell you his story
himself, that you may judge him. He declares that,
come what may, he will not rest with this shadow
upon him. In justice to us, his friends, and to himself,
he must face the consequences of his years of
wrongdoing. Hervey will be here for his money.
This is the position; and, according to my reckoning,
they will arrive at about the same time. I don&#8217;t
quite know why, but I want to confront Hervey with
the man he accuses. Now tell me what you think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking you make the third of a pack of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
fool-heads,&#8221; said the farm-wife gently. &#8220;George is
no murderer, he&#8217;s not the killin&#8217; sort. He&#8217;s a man, he
is. Then why worrit? An&#8217; say, if that boy o&#8217; mine
comes along he&#8217;ll learn that them Ar&#8217;tic goldfields is
a cooler place for his likes than his mother&#8217;s farm.&#8221;
The old woman&#8217;s choler was rising again with
tempestuous suddenness. &#8220;Say, he&#8217;s worse&#8217;n a skunk,
and a sight more dangerous than a Greaser. My,
but he&#8217;ll learn somethin&#8217; from them as can teach
him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, mother,&#8221; replied the girl, a little impatiently;
&#8220;but you don&#8217;t seem to see the seriousness of what
he charges&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That I do, miss. Am I wantin&#8217; in understandin&#8217;?
George is as innocent as an unborn babe, so what&#8217;s
the odds along o&#8217; Hervey&#8217;s accusin&#8217;? It don&#8217;t amount
to a heap o&#8217; corn shucks. That boy ain&#8217;t responsible,
I tell ye. He&#8217;s like to get locked up himself in a
luny &#8217;sylum. I&#8217;ll give him accusin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, mother, that won&#8217;t do any good. He must
be paid off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; so he shall&ndash;&ndash;and so he shall, child. There&#8217;s
more dollars in this farm than he reckons on, and
they&#8217;re ready for usin&#8217; when I say the word. If it&#8217;s
pay that&#8217;s needed, he shall be paid, though I ain&#8217;t
just understandin&#8217; the need.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sarah&#8217;s voice broke in at this point.</p>
<p>&#8220;The child&#8217;s right, Hephzibah; there&#8217;s money to be
spent over this thing, or I&#8217;m no judge of human
nature. Hervey&#8217;s got a strong case, and, from what
the story tells us, George is a doomed man if he goes
before the court. Innocent he may be&ndash;&ndash;innocent he
is, I&#8217;ll wager; but if he&#8217;s obstinate he&#8217;s done for.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></div>
<p>The farm-wife made no reply, but sat gazing
wistfully before her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; Prudence said earnestly. &#8220;It is just
the money&ndash;&ndash;nothing more. We must not let an
innocent man suffer. And, &#8216;Aunt&#8217; Sarah, we must
prevail upon George to let us stop Hervey&#8217;s mouth.
That is our chief difficulty. You will help me&ndash;&ndash;you
and mother. You are so clever, &#8216;Aunt&#8217; Sarah.
George will listen to you. Oh, we must&ndash;&ndash;must save
him, even against himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sarah nodded her head sagely; she was deeply
affected by all she had heard, but she gave no outward
sign.</p>
<p>&#8220;Child,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;we will all do our best&ndash;&ndash;for
him&ndash;&ndash;for you; but yours is the tongue that will
persuade him best. He loves you, child, and you love
him. He will not persist, if you are set against it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it will be as you say,&#8221; replied Prudence
dubiously. &#8220;But when he comes you will let him
tell his story in his own way. You will listen patiently
to him. Then you can laugh at his determination
and bring your arguments to bear. Then we will
keep him until Hervey arrives, and we will settle the
matter for ever. Oh, mother, I dread what is to
come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Mailing did not seem to be paying much heed,
but, as the girl moved away from her side, she spoke.
There was no grief, no anger in her voice now. She
spoke quite coldly, and Sarah Gurridge looked keenly
over at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, girl, we&#8217;ll settle this rumpus, and&ndash;&ndash;Hervey.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence moved towards the door. She turned at
her mother&#8217;s words.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I will go up-stairs,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I want to think.&#8221;</p>
<p>She opened the door and nearly fell against the
dog Neche, who was standing outside it. There was
a fanciful suggestion of the eavesdropper about the
creature; his attitude was almost furtive. He moved
slowly away, and walked with the girl to the foot of
the stairs, where he laid himself down with a complacent
grunt. The girl went up to her room.</p>
<p>&#8220;This day&#8217;s doin&#8217;s will be writ on my heart for
ever,&#8221; said the farm-wife plaintively, as the door closed
behind her daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; see you, Hephzibah, and let no eyes read of
them, for there will be little credit for anyone in those
same doings,&#8221; said Sarah solemnly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Malling hugged herself, and again began to
rock slowly. But there were no signs of tears in her
round, dark eyes. Now and again her lips moved,
and occasionally she muttered to herself. Sarah
heard the name &#8220;Hervey&#8221; pass her lips once or twice,
and she knew that her old friend had been sorely
stricken.</p>
<p>As the time for Iredale&#8217;s arrival drew near, Prudence
became restless. Her day had been spent in idleness
as far as her farm work was concerned. She had
chosen the companionship of Alice, and had unburdened
her heart to her. But sympathetic and
practical as her friend was, she was quite unable to
help her.</p>
<p>As four o&#8217;clock drew near, however, Alice did the
only thing possible. She took herself off for a walk
down the Lakeville trail. She felt that it was better
for everybody that she should be away while the
trouble was on, and, besides, she would meet her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
lover on his way to the farm, and give him timely
warning against making his meditated stay for the
night.</p>
<p>At the appointed hour there came the clatter of a
pacer&#8217;s hoofs at the front gate, and a moment later
Prudence led her lover into the parlour. After a few
brief words she hurriedly departed to summon her
mother and Sarah. There was a significant solemnity
in this assembling; nor was it lessened by the smuggler&#8217;s
manner. Even the wolfish Neche seemed
impressed with what was happening, for he clung to
the girl&#8217;s heels, following her wherever she went, and
finally laid down upon the trailing portion of her
skirt when she took up her position beside her lover
and waited for him to begin.</p>
<p>The opening was a painful one for everybody.
Iredale scarcely knew how to face those gentle folk
and recount his disgraceful story. He thought of
all they had been to him during his long years upon
the prairie. He thought of their implicit trust and
faith in him. He almost quailed before the steady,
honest eyes of the old people. However, he at last
forced himself to his task, and plunged into his story
with uncompromising bluntness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am accused of murder,&#8221; he said, and paused,
while a sickly feeling pervaded his stomach.</p>
<p>Mrs. Malling nodded her head. She was too open
to remain silent long.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of Leslie Grey,&#8221; she said at once. &#8220;And ye
needn&#8217;t to tell us nothin&#8217; more, George. We know
the yarn you are about to tell us. An&#8217; d&#8217;ye think
we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to believe any addle-pated scalliwag such
as my Hervey, agin&#8217; you? Smuggler you may be,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
but that you&#8217;ve sunk to killin&#8217; human flesh not even
a minister o&#8217; the Gospel&#8217;s goin&#8217; to convince me. Here,
I respects the man I give my hand to. Shake me by
the hand, George&ndash;&ndash;shake me by the hand.&#8221; And the
farm-wife rose from her chair and ambled across the
room with her hand outstretched.</p>
<p>Iredale clasped it in both of his. And never in his
life had he experienced such a burst of thankfulness
as he did at that moment. His heart was too full to
speak. Prudence smiled gravely as she watched this
whole-hearted token of her mother&#8217;s loyalty to a
friend. Nor was Sarah backward in her expression of
goodwill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hephzibah&#8217;s right, George, and she speaks for
both of us. But there&#8217;s work to be done for all that.
Hervey&#8217;s to be dealt with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be bribed,&#8221; said Hephzibah uncompromisingly,
as she returned to her seat.</p>
<p>Iredale shook his head and his face set sternly.
Prudence saw the look she feared creep into her
lover&#8217;s eyes. She opened her lips to protest, but the
words remained unspoken. She had heard the rattle
of a buckboard outside. The sound died away, and
she knew that the vehicle had passed round to the
barn. She waited in an agony of suspense for her
brother&#8217;s appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t to shake your head,&#8221; went on the
farm-wife. &#8220;This matter&#8217;s my concern. It&#8217;s my
dollars as is goin&#8217; to pay Master Hervey&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;
when he gets &#8217;em may they blister his fingers, I sez.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence heard a footstep in the hall. The crucial
moment had arrived, and her heart palpitated with
nervous apprehension. Before Iredale could reply the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
door was flung open, and Hervey stood in their midst.
Instantly every eye was turned upon him. He stood
for a moment and looked round. There was a slight
unsteadiness in his attitude. His great eyes looked
wilder than ever, and they were curiously bloodshot.
At least one of the three ladies possessed an observant
mind. Sarah saw that the man had been drinking.
To her the signs, though slight, were unmistakable.
The others did not seem to notice his condition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he said, with an attempt at pleasantry, &#8220;a
nice little party. Well, I&#8217;ve come for the dibs.&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes lit upon the figure of George Iredale, and
he broke off. The next moment he went on angrily&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that man doing in this house?&#8221; he cried,
his eyes fairly blazing with sudden rage. &#8220;Is the place
turned into a refuge for&ndash;&ndash;murderers?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s fury had set fire to the powder train.
His mother was on her feet in a twinkling. Her
comfortable body fairly shook in her indignation.
Her face was a flaming scarlet, and her round eyes
sparkled wickedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And who be you to question the calling of my
house, Hervey Malling?&#8221; she cried; &#8220;since when
comes it that you&#8217;ve the right to raise your voice
against my guests? An&#8217; by what right d&#8217;ye dare to
accuse an innocent man? Answer me, you imp of
Evil,&#8221; she demanded. But she gave him no time to
speak, and went on, her voice rising to a piercing
crescendo. &#8220;Spare your wicked tongue, which should
be forked by reason of the lies as has fallen from it.
Oh, that you should be able to call me &#8216;mother.&#8217; I&#8217;d
rather mother the offspring of a rattlesnake than you.
What have you done by us all your life but bring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
sorrow an&#8217; trouble upon those who&#8217;ve done all that
which in them is to help you? Coward! Traitor!
An&#8217; you come now with lies on your tongue to harm
an innocent man what&#8217;s done you no harm.&#8221; She
breathed hard. Then her wrath swept on, and the
room rang with the piercing pitch of her voice.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve come for your blood-money&ndash;&ndash;your thirty
pieces. You villain; if your poor father were alive
this day he should lay a raw hide about you till
your bones were flayed. Sakes! I&#8217;ve a mind to set
about you myself. Look at him, the black-heart!
Look at him all! Was ever such filth of a man? and
him my son. Blood-money! Blood-money! And
to think that I&#8217;m living to know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused. Hervey broke in&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Silence, you old fool! You don&#8217;t know what
you&#8217;re talking about. That man,&#8221; pointing over at
Iredale, who sat waiting for an opportunity to interfere,
&#8220;is the murderer of Leslie Grey. I suppose he
has been priming you with blarney and yarns. But
I tell you he murdered Grey. I&#8217;m not here for any
tomfoolery. I got Prudence&#8217;s message to say the
money was forthcoming. Where is it? Fifteen
thousand dollars buys me, and that I want at once.
If I have any more yapping I&#8217;ll make it twenty
thousand.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked about him savagely, and his eyes finally
paused at George Iredale, seated beside Prudence.
He cared nothing for his mother&#8217;s vituperation, but
he was watchful of the smuggler.</p>
<p>Suddenly the burly rancher sprang to his feet. He
stepped up to Hervey. The latter moved a pace
back.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Not one cent, you cowardly hound!&#8221; he roared.
&#8220;Not one cent shall you have; do you hear? I thank
God that I am here to stop you robbing these, your
mother and sister.&#8221; Mrs. Malling tried to interfere,
but he waved her back. &#8220;I&#8217;ve come at the right
time, and I tell you that you shall not take one
cent of the money. I will never leave you lest you
should wheedle it from them. I will spoil your game.
This is what I intend to do. You and I will set
out for Winnipeg to-night, and together we will
interview the Commissioner of Police. Do you understand
me? I have the whip hand now. And I
promise you your silence shall <i>not</i> be bought.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence interfered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to me, George. I implore you not to do
this thing. Hervey can have all he wants&ndash;&ndash;everything.
You are innocent we know, but you cannot
prove your innocence. Why should you break my
heart when there is a way out of the difficulty?
There is but one person who can denounce you, and
his silence we can purchase. Oh, George,&#8221; the girl
went on passionately, &#8220;as you love me, listen. My
heart will break if this thing you meditate comes
to pass. Oh, my love, say you won&#8217;t do it! Let
mother pay the man off that he may pass out of
our lives for ever. See, mother is going for the
money now. It is so easy; so simple.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Mailing had risen from her seat and moved
away to the door. Hervey stood at the far end of
the parlour facing the open window. He saw his
mother pass out, and a great look of satisfaction came
into his eyes. After all, these women meant to treat
him fairly, he thought.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span></div>
<p>He grinned over at Iredale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better drop it, Iredale, and don&#8217;t play the fool.
When I get the money I shall forget that I ever knew
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The smuggler was about to fire a swift retort when
the sound of voices coming in at the open window
interrupted him. The voices were a man&#8217;s and a
woman&#8217;s. Prudence recognized Alice&#8217;s tones. The
other&#8217;s she did not recognize at once.</p>
<p>Sarah Gurridge, who had been a silent observer of the
scene, had heard the sound too, but she was absorbed
in what was being enacted about her. Her eyes were
upon Hervey. She saw him start, and his great
haunting eyes were turned upon the window. Suddenly
he rushed forward towards it. He had to pass
round the table, close to where Prudence was now
standing. In doing so he kicked against the dog,
which was standing with its ears pricked up and its
head turned in the direction whence the voices
sounded.</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s evil face was blanched. A wild, hunted
look was in his eyes. Iredale saw, was startled, and
his reply died upon his lips as he wondered at this
sudden change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut the window. Do you hear?&#8221; cried Hervey
excitedly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let them hear. Don&#8217;t let
them&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He had reached the window to carry out his own
instructions. His hands were upon the casements,
and he was about to fling the glass frames together.
But suddenly his arms dropped to his sides. He
stood face to face with the figure of Robb
Chillingwood!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span></div>
<p>There was a dreadful silence. Then slowly Hervey
backed away; his glaring eyes were fixed upon the
stern countenance of the ex-Customs officer. Slowly
he backed, backed from the apparition; and the onlookers
noted the pallid cheeks and blazing eyes, and
they wondered helplessly. Nor did Hervey pause
until he reached the wall furthest from the window.
Then he stood, and his lips silently moved.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a cry, and it rang with vengeful
triumph. It came from the man at the window&ndash;&ndash;Robb
Chillingwood.</p>
<p>&#8220;By God! it&#8217;s Zachary Smith!&#8221;</p>
<p>The next instant and he was in the room.</p>
<p>The onlookers gazed blankly from one to the other
of the two men. What did it mean? Who was
Zachary Smith? And why did Robb so call Hervey?
Then their eyes settled on the man against the wall.
The cheeks were no longer pallid; they were flushed
with a hectic colouring, and those strange eyes were
filled with an awful, murderous light. The lips
continued to move, but he did not speak; only his
right hand slipped round behind him.</p>
<p>Then Robb&#8217;s voice sounded through the room
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, Mr. Zachary Smith, we meet again. And,
by the Lord Harry, you shall swing for what you
did in the mountains! Highway robbery of the
Government bullion under the charge of Leslie Grey,
and the murder of our Indian guide, Rainy-Moon.&#8221;
Then he turned&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Hold that door!&#8221; he shouted;
and Iredale sprang to obey.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Prudence rushed forward, but Sarah
stopped her and drew her back.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span></div>
<p>A wild laugh came from Hervey&#8217;s direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;And who&#8217;s going to take me?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You,
Robb Chillingwood, you? Ha, ha!&#8221; and his maniacal
laugh rang out again. &#8220;Look to yourself, you fool.
Grey crossed my path, and he paid for it with his
life. You shall follow him.&#8221;</p>
<p>While his words yet rang upon the air his hand
shot out from behind him, gripping a heavy revolver.
The pistol was raised, and a shriek went up from the
two ladies.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a rush, a snarl; and a great
body seemed to literally hurl itself through the air.
A shot rang out; simultaneously a cry echoed
through the room; Hervey staggered as something
seized him by the throat and tore away the soft
flesh; another shot followed.</p>
<p>It all happened in a twinkling. Hervey fell to the
ground with a gurgling cry, and Neche, the dog, until
then forgotten by everybody, rolled over by his side
with one dying yelp of pain. Then silence reigned
throughout the room and all was still.</p>
<p>Iredale returned his smoking pistol to his pocket,
and went over to Hervey&#8217;s side. His movements
seemed to release the others from the spell under
which they had been held. Robb, unharmed by
Hervey&#8217;s shot, came forward, and Sarah and Prudence
followed in his wake. But Iredale waved the ladies
back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand away, please,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;The dog
had finished him before I got my shot in to save him.
The brute has literally torn his throat out.&#8221; Then
he looked over at the dead hound. &#8220;It&#8217;s awful; I
wonder what made the dog turn upon him?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Are they both dead?&#8221; asked Robb, in an awestruck
voice.</p>
<p>Iredale nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have been the sight of Hervey&#8217;s levelled
pistol that made the dog rush at him,&#8221; said Prudence.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen him do so before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Strange, strange,&#8221; murmured Iredale.</p>
<p>&#8220;That dog feared firearms,&#8221; said Sarah.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he had reason,&#8221; observed Robb significantly,
&#8220;he only has three sound legs. My God!
And not content with his victims in the mountains,
he&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;But, yes, I see it. This man came here without
expecting to meet Grey or me.&#8221; Robb broke off
and looked at Prudence. &#8220;Of course, I am beginning
to understand. You and Grey were to have been
married.&#8221; Then he turned back to the contemplation
of the dead bodies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the murderer of Grey lies confessed,&#8221; said
Iredale quietly, &#8220;and I think that his motives were
even stronger than those attributed to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Prudence placed a hand over his mouth before he
could complete his sentence.</p>
<p>They were startled from their horrified contemplation
of the work of those last few moments by the
sound of Hephzibah&#8217;s voice calling from her bedroom.
The sitting-room door had been opened by
Alice, who had entered the moment Iredale had
released the handle. Now they could hear the farm-wife
moving about overhead, evidently on her way
down-stairs.</p>
<p>Sarah was the first to recover her presence of mind.
She turned upon Robb.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a word to her about&ndash;&ndash;about&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span></div>
<p>Robb shook his head.</p>
<p>Iredale snatched the pistol from the dead man&#8217;s
hand.</p>
<p>Mrs. Malling&#8217;s footsteps came creaking down the
stairs. Suddenly Prudence&#8217;s hands went up to her
face as she thought of the shock awaiting her mother.
Alice dragged her away to a chair. Iredale and
Robb stood looking down at the two objects on
the floor. Master and hound were lying side by
side.</p>
<p>Sarah ran to the door and met the farm-wife. She
must never know that her son was a murderer&ndash;&ndash;a
double murderer.</p>
<p>Those within the room heard the school-ma&#8217;am&#8217;s
gentle tones.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Hephzibah, you must not go in there yet.
There are things&ndash;&ndash;things which you must not see.
The hound has killed him. Hervey enraged the dog,
and the wretched beast turned upon him&ndash;&ndash;and he is
dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there came the sound of a scuffle. The next
moment mother Hephzy pushed her way into the
room. She looked about her wildly; one hand was
clutching a bundle of hundred-dollar bills. Suddenly
her round, staring eyes fell upon the two objects
lying side by side upon the ground. She looked at
the hound; then she looked upon her son. Iredale
had covered the torn throat with pocket-handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>The bills slowly fell in a shower from her hand,
and her arms folded themselves over her breast.
Then she looked in a dazed fashion upon those about
her, muttering audibly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dead&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s dead,&#8221; she repeated to herself
over and over again. Then suddenly she ceased her
repetitions and shook her head. &#8220;Mussy-a-me, mussy-a-me!
The Lord&#8217;s will be done!&#8221;</p>
<p>And she slowly fell in a heap by her dead son&#8217;s
side.</p>

<h3>IN CONCLUSION</h3>
</div>
<p>Time, the great healer of all sufferings, all sorrows,
can do much, but memory clings with a pertinacity
which defies all Time&#8217;s best efforts. Time may
soften the poignancy of deep-rooted sorrow, but it
cannot shut out altogether the pain of a mother&#8217;s
grief at the loss of an only son. In spite of all
Hervey&#8217;s crimes he was &#8220;the only son of his mother,
and she was a widow.&#8221; The story of his villainies
was rigidly kept from her, and so she thought of him
only as a prodigal, as a boy to be pitied, as one whose
offences must be condoned; she sought for his good
points, and, in her sweet motherly heart, saw a
wonderful deal in him on which to centre her loving
memory, which, had he lived, even she could never
have discovered. It is something that erring man has
to be humbly grateful for, that women are like this;
so full of the patient, enduring love which can see no
wrong in the object of their affections.</p>
<p>But Loon Dyke Farm became intolerable to Hephzibah
Malling after the ghastly tragedy of her son&#8217;s
death; and when Robb and Alice saw fit to marry,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
urged on to that risky experiment by the two older
ladies, she insisted upon leasing the place to them on
ridiculously easy terms. She would have given it to
them only for their steady refusal to accept such a
magnificent wedding gift from her.</p>
<p>The old lady was rich enough for her needs and
her daughter&#8217;s, and, business woman as she was, she
was generous to a fault where her affections were concerned.
Prudence too was satisfied with any arrangement
which would take her away from the farm.
Knowing what she knew of her brother, Loon Dyke
could never again be her home. So mother and
daughter retired to Ainsley, and only once again did
they return to their old home on the briefest of visits,
and that was to assist at the function of christening
the son and heir of the Chillingwoods.</p>
<p>Later on Prudence induced her mother to make
Winnipeg her home, but though, for her daughter&#8217;s
sake, she acceded to the request, she was never quite
at ease among her new surroundings. Nor was Sarah
Gurridge, when she visited her old friend during her
holidays, slow to observe this. &#8220;My dear,&#8221; she told
Alice, one day after her summer vacation, &#8220;Hephzibah
is failing fast. She&#8217;s quite old, although she is
my junior by two years and three months. An idle
life doesn&#8217;t suit her; and as for Prudence, she wears
fine clothes, and goes out in society all day and most
of the night, but she&#8217;s that thin and melancholy that
you wouldn&#8217;t know her for the same child. It&#8217;s my
opinion that she&#8217;s pining&ndash;&ndash;they are both pining. I
found a letter from Hamilton when I got back home.
It was from George Iredale, and I&#8217;m going to answer
it at once.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And what are you going to say in your reply?&#8221;
laughed Alice. &#8220;I know your matchmaking propensity.
So does Robb.&#8221;</p>
<p>The quiet, dreamy face of the old school-mistress
smiled over at the happy mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say?&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to give
George a piece of my mind for staying away so long.
I know why he&#8217;s doing so, and my belief as to the
cause of his absence is different from what Prudence
is beginning to imagine. She thinks he has left her
because of her brother&#8217;s doings, and it&#8217;s that that&#8217;s
driving her to an early grave. I shall certainly tell
George what I think.&#8221; And Sarah wagged her head
sagely.</p>
<p>And she was as good as her word. She had not
seen fit to tell Alice that she had been in constant
communication with George Iredale ever since the
day of the tragedy, or that she was in his confidence
as regarded Prudence. George had left the district
to give both Prudence and her mother time to recover
from the shock. And now that a year or more had
passed away, he had written appealing to Sarah to
tell him if she thought the time auspicious for his
return.</p>
<p>In a long, carefully-worded letter Sarah advised
him not to delay.</p>
<p>&#8220;By dint of much perseverance,&#8221; she wrote, &#8220;I have
persuaded the child out of her absurd notions about
the reflections her brother&#8217;s doings have cast upon
her. She looks at things from a healthier standpoint
now. Why should she not marry? What has she
done to debar her from fulfilling the mission which
is appointed for every woman? Nothing! And I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
am sure if a certain man should return and renew the
appeal which he made at the time when the Lord&#8217;s
anger was visited upon her brother, she would give
him a different reply. However, I must not waste all
my space upon the silly notions of a child with a
misdirected conscience.&#8221;</p>
<p>And how her letter bore fruit, and how George
Iredale returned and sought Prudence in the midst
of the distractions of Winnipeg&#8217;s social whirl, and
how the girl&#8217;s answer, when again he appealed to her,
turned out to be the one Sarah had prophesied for
him, were matters of great satisfaction to the sage old
school-mistress.</p>
<p>She assisted at the wedding which followed, she
saw the bride and bridegroom off at the railway dep&ocirc;t,
she remained to console her old friend for the loss of
her daughter. Then she hied her off once more, back
to the bleak, staring school-house, where she continued
to propound sage maxims for the young of the district
until her allotted task was done, and the tally
of her years complete.</p>
